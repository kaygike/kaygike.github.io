## 2001: A Space Odyssey
<div>
2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 novel by Arthur C. Clarke developed concurrently with the Stanley Kubrick film of the same name.

**Part I. Primeval Night.** 

Early man struggles to survive. They encounter a "New Rock" (Africus Monolith, e.g. TMA-0) which stimulates new mental activity, slowly leading to their development of more advanced tools and greater dominance over nature.

**Part 2. TMA-1.** 

A quarantine on the moon is a cover story for a recent discovery nicknamed TMA-1, or the Tycho [crater] Magnetic Anomaly-1. TMA-1 is a black rectangular monolith dated 3,000,000 years old, found buried on the moon. It is the first evidence of extra-terrestrial intelligence, and emits five bursts of electronic shrieks while under investigation.

**Part 3. Between Planets.** 

Five astronauts head towards Saturn on the Discovery spacecraft, guided by an artificially intelligent computer named HAL 9000. Three of the astronauts are in hibernation, and they pass Jupiter en route.

**Part 4. Abyss.** 

HAL 9000 continually detects a malfunction in a critical communication device, even after one of the crew members replaces it. As ground control suggests that HAL 9000 itself may be malfunctioning, the device "fails" and communication with Earth is lost. Attempting to replace the device yet again, the pod abruptly changes position and knocks the crew member into deep space. HAL 9000 takes control of the ship and kills three of the remaining four crew members by opening the airlock while they’re sedated in hibernation. HAL 9000 is protecting the true, classified purpose of the mission -- to explore a moon of Saturn suspected to be the origin of the TMA-1 monolith -- before he is disconnected by the sole remaining crew member, Dave.

**Part 5. The Moons of Saturn.**

Dave continues towards Saturn as a lone ambassador from Earth. He spots a larger version of TMA-1 on its surface, which was placed there 3,000,000 years ago by intelligent, extraterrestrial, extra-spatial life. As Dave nears Saturn’s monolith, the monolith unfolds spacetime absorbs Dave’s ship into its abyss. Dave senses he’s moving at incredible speed and believes the monolith to be some sort of "star gate" that facilitates faster-than-light travel. His pod lands in what appears to be an ordinary hotel room, prepared for someone of his species to eventually discover. He sleeps, relives his past, and is transformed into an extra-spatial omnipotent being ("Star-Child") with the power to influence matter and help guide mankind through a new stage of evolution.

## Atlas Shrugged
<div>
Atlas Shrugged is a 1957 novel by Ayn Rand. It espouses her philosophy of Objectivism.

**Characters**

The primary protagonist is Dagny Taggart, a VP at the Taggart Transcontinental railroad business run by her brother James. Dagny is self-sufficient, efficient, and scourns government interference in the business. Her brother James is a dirty statist and egalitarian who welcomes government interference in the business.

A secondary protagonist is James Rearden, a pessimistic entrepreneur who invents Rearden Metal, cheaper yet stronger than traditional steel. Dagny is excited by the prospects of the new alloy whereas her brother James, despite Rearden Metal’s clear superiority, is more concerned on its potential impact on the legacy steel industry.

**Synopsis**

Dagny learns that her old friend and lover, copper magnate Francisco d'Anconia, is intentionally sabotaging his business. She also discovers a revolutionary new motor design in an abandoned factory, with no known inventor or applied use; she can't comprehend either of these discoveries -- why Francisco is destroying his business or why an inventor would abandon the new motor design.

The government steps up its economic interference by nationalizing patents and forbidding employees from quitting. Dagny has finally had enough and illegally leaves her job in defiance of the order, but ends up returning to Taggart Transcontinental after a disaster occurs in one of their tunnels. Dagny begins to hear more and more people mutter under their breathes, "Who is John Galt?" -- an expression of resignation (i.e. "what's the use?") and, we eventually learn, a literal question about a man.

Dagny crashes a private plan while chasing an employee whom she hoped to convince not to leave the company. Among the wreckage, she finally learns why d’Anconia was sabotaging his business; why the new motor designer did nothing with his invention; to where some of the world's leading tycoons had disappeared -- a man named John Galt had convinced them all to leave the world behind and to live quietly in his hidden Gulch instead, as a protest against the government's increasing intervention and expropriation of their work and the economy.

When Dagny peeks her head back out into the world, the government is even more incompetent and totalitarian than before. John Galt delivers a three-hour speech over the radio urging them to take pride in their own work; to forge forward and invent and create; to be in charge of their own destinies; to refuse to allow the government to siphon, steal, and tax their creative output and livelihoods to death. Galt is arrested but quickly rescued by his minions, and New York City plunges into chaos as the electricity goes out. Such is the planned, centralized economy of government intervention, and among its ruins, John Galt and his followers are prepared to rebuild anew.

## The Brothers Karamazov
<div>
The Brothers Karamazov is an 1880 philosophical novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky. It tells the story of four brothers and the murder of their father.

**Characters**

Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is a selfish codger with four sons by three mothers.

The eldest son, Dmitri (Mitya), is a "bad Catholic" -- or what some simply call "Catholic." Specific theologies aside, Dmitri is a sinner seeking salvation. He does bad, but seeks good. He succumbs to his basest, primal impulses, yet occasionally manages to deny them in pursuit of spiritual redemption. He is a man, flaws and all. Dmitri's central conflicts with his father involve a love triangle with a younger woman and an inheritance from his mother which he hasn’t access to.

The middle son, Ivan (Vanya), is the intellectual. He is analytical, calculated, and deeply concerned with human suffering. He could be a brilliant theologian if only he could reconcile the existence of human suffering with a belief in God, but alas, he cannot. Ivan would rather be wrong but win a debate than be right and lose a debate. He's a showman who loves exposing contradictions but, because he cannot logically solve life's great questions, doesn't live a particularly joyful life. His words inadvertently lead to Fyodor’s murder and Dmitri’s unjust condemnation.

The youngest son, Alexei (Alyosha), is the faithful one. He studies beneath Father Zosima, who encourages him to gain experience in the real world before cloistering himself in a monastery. He is loving, forgiving, and naive. Alexei loves his brothers, as he loves all, and occasionally helps them moderate their sinful pursuits. He tutors young children in moral character and faith, and ultimately redeems the Karamazov name so tainted by his father.

The rejected son, Smerdyakov (Pavel), is an epileptic bastard. He serves as Fyodor's house servant. He is the son of "Reeking Lizaveta", a mute who died in childbirth after (allegedly) getting knocked up by Fyodor. Smerdyakov tortured animals growing up. He love-hates his father and loves his brother Ivan. His actions advertently lead to Fyodor's murder and inadvertently to Ivan's mental breakdown.

**Book I**

The novel starts with an introduction to the family.

**Books II & III**

They visit Father Zosima to help mediate the dispute over the inheritance from Dmitri's mother, but to no avail. There is a deeper conflict beneath it all -- Fyodor and Dmitri are in love with the same woman.

**Book IV**

Alyosha tries to help a schoolboy who's being bullied, but ends up apologizing to the boy’s father for Dmitri's past behavior.

**Book V**

 Ivan jests with Alyosha over his faith, and launches into a long poem titled The Grand Inquisitor. In the poem, Jesus returns during the Spanish inquisition, is imprisoned, and is chastised for his decision to grant free will to man, as that responsibility was too great a burden and led to human suffering. In response, Jesus kisses his prison guard and is released. Upon hearing the poem, Alyosha kisses his brother Ivan.

**Book VI**

Father Zosima recounts his life story, and explains his belief that everyone shares responsibility for their neighbors' sins.

**Book VII**

Father Zosima dies and his body decomposes, disappointing many who believe that the bodies of holy men don't decompose in death. Alyosha mourns his mentor and ventures back into the world, per Father Zosima's earlier instructions.

**Book VIII**

Dmitri stalks outside of his father Fyodor's house, suspecting that the woman whom they both love went to visit his father. He carries a brass pestle. Time flashes forward and Dmitri flees the property, knocking a servant out along the way. Dmitri gets drunk while covered in blood and carrying a wad of money, and is subsequently arrested for the murder of Fyodor.

**Book IX**

Dmitri is interrogated. He admits to striking the servant, but denies murdering his father and refuses to explain how he came into money. This is complicated by the fact that money went missing from Fyodor's house upon the murder. The only other possible suspect is Smerdyakov, but he was in an epileptic fit when the murder occurred. For lack of better explanation and Dmitri's refusal to disclose how he acquired the money, he is formally charged and imprisoned.

**Book X**

A friend of the schoolboy met earlier in Book IV is growing up to be a smart-ass atheist, like Ivan. Alyosha challenges the boy's nihilism.

**Book XI**

Ivan meets three times with Smerdyakov and eventually learns the Smerdyakov is the murderer. Smerdyakov admits to faking an epileptic fit and murdering their father. He offers Ivan the stolen money and explains that he never would’ve murdered the old man were it not for Ivan, for it was through Ivan whom Smerdyakov learned that all is permissible and that religious morality is herd mentality. Ivan is horrified by the impact of his words and suffers a mental breakdown. The devil visits him in hallucinations and mocks his beliefs. Smerdyakov commits suicide without confessing to anyone else, and intentionally omits his responsibility for the murder from his suicide note.

**Book XII**

A mockery of trial finds Dmitri guilty. Ivan remains tormented by guilt, and has yet to recover from his mental breakdown.

**Epilogue**

Dmitri accepts his fate. There's talk of an escape plan and he reconciles with one of his former lovers who falsely accused him during the trial. But no escape is to be witnessed. Instead, Alyosha leads a funeral service for a young schoolboy recently departed. He implores the children to love deep and wide, to forgive all, and to cherish every moment and memory they have. The boys are enraptured by his speech, and end the novel cheering "Hurrah for Karamazov." In Alyosha, the Karamazov family name has been redeemed.

## Bushido: The Soul of Japan
<div>
Bushido: The Soul of Japan is a 1900 book by Inazo Nitobé. It is an explanation and musing for western audiences of the character, ethics, and history of the Japanese samurai.

According to author Inazo Nitobé, _Bu-shi-do_ translates to _Military-Knight-Ways_ -- the character, teachings, ethics, and chivalry of Japanese sword-warriors. The system is simple: total allegiance to master, death for dishonor, sword as last resort, and honor over all. To die for an unworthy cause is cowardice; to slay an unworthy foe is murder.

For better or worse, samurai are depicted as the archetypal warrior-poet. He is stoic, steadfast, and dangerous, yet has self-control and lives in harmony with the dis/order of society. Nitobé defends old Japan from the ethical, political, and social criticism levied by the prevailing cultural hegemony (barbarism, imperialism, classism, sexism). The Japanese order is bound by a voluntary, self-imposed ethic of duty, honor, and restraint unknown to the West.

> "Only a pomegranate is he" —  so runs a popular saying —  "who, when he gapes his mouth, displays the contents of his heart."

_Seppuku_ or _kappuku_ (_hara-kiri_) was not mere suicide — it was ceremonial. The use of disembowelment was based on the ancient belief of the gut as the seat of the soul. Bearing it openly was an offering to view their innermost character for judgement.

> No one circle in the Inferno will boast of greater density of Japanese population than the seventh, to which Dante consigns all victims of self-destruction!

Bushido "set a moral standard for [the populace] and guided them by their example." Although it lives no longer as a system, it is immortal as a virtue. For "wherever man struggles to raise himself above himself, wherever his spirit masters his flesh by his own exertions, there we see the immortal discipline of Zeno at work."

## Candide
<div>
Candide is a 1759 novella by François-Marie Arouet aka Voltaire.

The story is not only too short for a good synopsis, but also not good enough for one. Technically it's satire, but of the boring variety with little humor or wit. Basically, it ridicules Leibniz's theodicy of the “"est of all possible worlds" -- his attempt to solve the "problem of evil" -- by showing an optimist continually being shat upon.

Unlike Joyce's _A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_ which, in its critique of Christianity, at least attempts to faithfully represent the Catholic tradition and experience, Candide attacks a straw man.

That it's considered Voltaire's magnum opus doesn't bode well for the value of his other works (admittedly unread by this author). Its crowning achievement seems only to be that he shat upon some Christian theology before radical secularism trickled into Europe after the French Revolution.
</div>

## The Carlyle Anthology
<div>
The Carlyle Anthology is an 1876 collection of Thomas Carlyle excerpts compiled by Edward Barrett.

It's a very accessible introduction to Carlyle's thought, as it covers his biographical profiles, his great man theory of history, his ideas on the power and virtue of the written word, and some of his political arguments against populism and universal suffrage.

Carlyle's writing style can be a difficult for modern readers due to his prose and punctuation style, so these shorter excerpts may be easier to digest than his full works. The anthology is broken into six sections: (1) Life, and the Conduct of Life; (2) Portraits and Characters; (3) Literature, and the Literary Life; (4) Religion; (5) Politics; and (6) Historical and Miscellaneous.

## Crime and Punishment
<div>
Crime and Punishment is an 1866 novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

Raskolnikov, a poor man in St. Petersburg, schemes to rob an old pawnshop owner for her money. After scouting out her apartment, he returns with an axe, pretending that he wants to pawn an item. Raskolnikov strikes her down, and then her half-sister when she walks into the room. In panic, he flees with a small handfull of items worth far less than the lives he took.

Despite not being an immediate suspect, Raskolnikov falls ill from the psychological burden of his murders. He becomes prone to fainting, fevers, and delirium. Thoughts of confession preoccupy him. Those near and attending to him are Luzhin, his sister Dunya’s wealthy fiance; Razumikhin, an old friend; and Zamyotov, a policeman. After revisiting the apartment, morbidly obsessed with the murders, he returns home and faints upon finding his mother and sister awaiting him.

Raskolnikov fiercely opposes Dunya's marriage to Luzhin, believing him to be an opportunist and Dunya motivated only by the security his money can provide the family. His friend Razumikhin takes him to see Petrovich, a detective, and Raskolnikov suspects that Petrovich already knows he’s guilty of the murders. Petrovich questions him about an old article he wrote, On Crime, which argued that certain people are both legally and morally justified to commit forbidden acts (such as theft and murder) in pursuit of their ideas.

A former suitor of Dunya, Svidrigailov, is in Raskolnikov's room when he wakes the next morning. Svidrigailov insists that Dunya call off her engagement to Luzhin, and bequeaths 3,000 rubles to Dunya per his late wife’s will. Dunya sends Luzhin away, and the family is relieved to finally have some money on hand.

Raskolnikov heads back into an interview with Petrovich, who insinuates that he knows Raskolnikov is guilty of murdering the pawnbroker Alyona and her half-sister Lizaveta. To both their surprise, a young painter bursts into the station and confesses to the murders.

After a funeral banquet for a man that Raskolnikov saw killed earlier in the street by a carriage, he heads home with the deceased's daughter, Sonya, upon whom he's taken pity. Raskolnikov confesses to his crime and desperately tries to explain his motives and thus justify his actions. Sonya, however, herself in pain but pious, urges him to confess to save his conscious and soul. They rush outside after hearing that her step-mother is throwing a fit in the street after being evicted from her apartment. There he sees Svidrigailov, who directly quotes Raskolnikov's earlier admission to Sonya, tacitly revealing that he overheard the entire confession.

Soon thereafter, Petrovich surprises Raskolnikov for a quick chat, and tells him straight-out that he knows Raskolnikov is the murderer, that Raskolnikov will be arrested soon, and that it would be better for all if he would simply confess. Svidrigailov tells Dunya about her brother's confession to Sonya, and with no chance of her requitted love, commits suicide the next morning in public.

Raskolnikov says goodbye to his mother and sister, receives a crucifix from Sonya, and heads to the police station. There he learns of Svidrigailov's suicide and makes a full confession. He is sentenced to eight years of labor in Siberia, during which his mother passes. Sonya follows him to Siberia, and despite feeling unworthy of her love, he accepts his sins and seeks redemption in Sonya's loving presence.

## Democracy: The God that Failed
<div>
Democracy: The God That Failed is a 2001 book by Hans-Hermann Hoppe. It is a critique of democracy and a defense of private property rights.

Below is a summary of the introduction and first chapter, which outline his thesis and key concepts.

**Introduction**

Democracy is a relatively young phenomenon. Before the Great War (WWI), only three republics existed in Europe (France, Switzerland, Portugal). But Woodrow Wilson, in his declaration of war against Germany, specifically said that "The world must be made safe for democracy." Thus Total War ensued, and Total War requires total surrender. Germany lost its monarchy; the Austrian-Hungarian Empire was abolished; Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia were carved out. Without the ideological push for democracy behind WWI, one must wonder how difficult and likely it would have been for the Bolsheviks to seize Russia, the Fascists to seize Italy, and the Nazis to seize Germany if the monarchies were preserved. (ix-xiv)

The collapse of the Soviet Empire demonstrated the failure of socialism, not the triumph of capitalism -- for, in less than a century, "full blown democracy" has led to moral degeneration, family and social disintegration, and cultural decay in the forms of divorce, illegitimacy, abortion, and crime. (xiii)

The Austrian method of praxeology is logical deduction from _a priori_ theory. If the deduction is valid and the _a priori_ statement is true, then the deduction is necessarily true and by definition no empirical evidence can falsify it. Historical data or empirical evidence can illustrate these deductions, but not establish or refute them. Examples of these _a priori_ statements are "satisfaction earlier is preferred to satisfaction later," and "no one can purposefully not act." (xvi-xviii)

Three theses are provided:

1. Hereditary monarchies can be understood as privately-owned government. With the claim to authority being hereditary, these institutions tend to promote future-orientedness and protection of private property rights;
2. Democracies can be understood as publicly-owned governments. With the constant transition of power and influence of majority (mob) rule, these institutions tend to promote present-orientedness and dissolution of private property rights;
3. _If_ one must have a state (a compulsory territorial monopoly of ultimate decision-making and taxation), then monarchies are economically and ethically more advantageous to democracies, and "natural orders" or "anarcho-capitalism" (social systems free of monopoly and taxation) are economically and ethically more advantageous and justified than monarchies. (xix-xx)

**Time Preference & Civilization**

"Time preference" is man's preference for earlier goods over later goods. This is because time is scarce, future time is uncertain, and present needs must be met before expected needs in the future. A high or rising time preference places greater emphasis on the present, whereas a low or falling time preference places less emphasis on the present. Both cases prefer present goods to later goods, but the latter is more likely to be willing to defer present consumption for future consumption. (1)

Lower time preferences initiate a "process of civilization." They facilitate the availability of loanable funds (since these cannot exist without previous savings) such that investments can be made in the present which will yield future returns. These investments produce more durable goods, make people's lives more comfortable, and increase people's life expectancy. Factors which can contribute to a decrease in time preference are maturation from childhood to adulthood and advancement of knowledge. If time preferences were always high, then nobody would forgo current consumption for the sake of future consumption, i.e. nobody would save and there would be no investment. (3-8)

Capital goods are valued only insofar as they are intermediate products used to turn out final consumer goods. The consumer is sovereign and all prices (less institutional interference) in the supply chain are adjusted according to his demand and willingness to pay. The difference in price between a final consumer good and the originary factors required to produce it is the price paid for time, i.e. possessing the good today rather than creating it oneself. (3)

**Investment & Interference**

In the beginning, there was only "land" (natural resources) and "labor" (human bodies). Everything else was the result of somebody appropriating (homesteading) nature and acting upon it (with labor or technical knowledge). A potato in hand today (natural resource), a belief or understanding of how potatoes grow (technical knowledge), and the willingness to forgo consumption of that potato today (savings) are all required in order for someone to plant that potato and yield ten new potatoes for consumption next year. These sorts of appropriations and transformations increase the value of one's present goods, which in turn decreases one’s time-preference rate. Where property rights are violated and goods are stolen, or under conditions where this is more likely to occur, then the supply or value of present goods decreases, which in turn increases time preference. (9-11)

Crime and the risk or likelihood of crime causes one to lose present goods or reallocate those goods, which effectively raises one's time-preference rate -- just as an increase in natural disasters reduces supply of present goods and increases time preference. Likewise, civilization is permanently impaired when government violates property rights or enacts regulation which limits what an owner may or may not do with their property, as victims may not legitimately defend themselves against such violations. Like crime, these interferences on private-property rights by government reduce the supply of present goods and raise time-preference rates, but unlike crime, these interferences are continual and institutionalized, and so further increase risks of future production and decrease expected returns on future production. (12-14)

**Public & Private Government**

Governments are territorial monopolists with an inherent tendency toward growth. Different forms of government lead to differing degrees of decivilization (falling time preferences), but all are a constant threat to civilization (rising time preferences). Typically, governments start small, and usually in the form of personal rule or private ownership of government (monarchy). These private owners are more likely to be already socially recognized as an elite, with some record of past achievement. Democracies, on the other hand, cannot naturally acquire legitimacy in the same way; they gain legitimacy by war or revolution. (15-17)

Kings and queens, as private owners of government, have a lower time preference than democratic leaders precisely because their role as governors includes ownership. If they tax too high, future production falls and thus future income falls. Their personal ownership over government incentivizes them to preserve the present value of their kingdom. In addition, since nobody outside the immediate family can ever expect to become the next king, this private ownership further incentivizes the governors to preserve the long-run value of the kingdom, since it is their own family which stands to benefit. For the ruled, without any realistic access into government, they develop a clearer "class consciousness" as a member of the "governed public," and thus resist government's power to tax further as well as government's ability to wage war, since territorial expansion is viewed as a ruler's private business which they must finance themselves. (19-23)

Democrats, on the other hand, can use government to their advantage but do not own it. They have a limited window to plunder and profit from their position of power, and so have no incentive to preserve the capital value of the nation, as they lose access to any resources left unappropriated when they leave office. Instead of maintaining or enhancing the resources and production power of the nation, democrats will "use up as much of the government resources as quickly as possible, for what he does not consume now, he may never be able to consume." Furthermore, since anybody can conceivably become a member of the ruling class, the governed public has a fuzzier class consciousness, and therefore offers weaker resistance against government power. This results in higher tax rates and greater numbers of people as public servants with higher degrees of time preference. (24-26)

**Debt, Private Property & Redistribution**

Public governments are also more likely to incur debt, since those debts are owned by the public, whereas kings and queens are constrained by the fact that they and their heirs are personally liable for repayment. (27)

More importantly, kings & queens will want to strengthen private property laws since their own kingdoms are their private property; to weaken private property rights effectively weakens their own claim over the territory. Thus, they seek to uphold preexisting private property law. In contrast, public governments create and administer their own laws -- laws which exempt government agents from liability -- which subverts and supercedes the prevailing private law and erodes property rights. (28)

This erosion of private law and prevailing property rights is further exascerbated by suffrage. Since, in democracies, anybody can run for government, "the advocacy and adoption of redistributive policies is predestined to become the very prerequisite for anyone wanting to attain or retain a government caretaker position." Private governments represent a "consumption state" while democracies are transformed in a "welfare state." (29)

Hoppe identifies three forms of redistribution: (1) transfer payments from the haves to the have-nots; (2) "free" or subsidized access to goods and services; and (3) "protection laws" which benefit one group of businessmen or consumers over other competing groups. Regardless of form, redistribution policies have two core effects: they increase uncertainty of the future, which as explained above is a decivilizing force, and they reward non-producers at the expense of more productive members of society. Consequently, the future will be more uncertain, investment in the future will decrease, time preferences for the present will rise, the underperforming will be rewarded, and the most productive members of society will be punished. There is now less incentive to work and earn income, more immediate consumption, more shortsightedness, and all of these negative effects reinforce each other. (30-33)

**Warfare**

Private governments are expected to finance their own wars; public governments can effectively rack up as much debt as they want for it. Privately-owned governments can engage better in treaties, since there is less likelihood a new administration will nullify them; they can also intermarry to secure peace instead of waging war. In contrast, public governments wage Total War driven by ideology (see Introduction above). (36-41)

As for the track record of publicly-owned governments, besides Total War on a global scale, it also has the unique distinction of producing communism, fascism, and national socialism. Public governments have produced an endless rise of taxes, debt, inflation, and public employment. At the same time, marriage has weakened, birth rates and wages have declined or stagnated, and there have been increasing rates of divorce, illegitimacy, single parenthood, and abortion. (42)

In conclusion of the first chapter, Hoppe explains that public opinion is the only means by which to prevent this continual process of decivilization. Government itself (public or private) is not to be praised for civilization; rather, strong private property rights (and individual responsibility) are responsible for civilization, through its tendency to decrease time-preference (and thus increase saving and investment). (43)

## Don't Vote -- It Just Encourages the Bastards
<div>
Don't Vote — It Just Encourages the Bastards is a 2010 book by P. J. O'Rourke. It describes the American politico-economic system and his personal journey from the left-wing to libertarianism.
Synopsis

For better or worse, this is one of P. J. O'Rourke's more serious books. He spends a fair amount of time on political theory, e.g. the U.S. model as one of free people consenting to being governed as opposed to governed people permitted to be "free," and the "pursuit of happiness" as an unparalleled unalienable right among the founding documents and constitutions of developed nations.

He also delights in delineating between negative and positive rights, or "get-outa-heres" and "gimmes." Negative rights are freedoms from or shall nots, whereas positive rights are for or rights to something (e.g. "shall not be infringed" vs. "shall enjoy the right to").

> Positive rights themselves, in turn, are absurdly expandable... Even negative rights aren’t free... But positive rights require no end of money.

One of O'Rourke's core theses is that the free market is not an economic ideology, per se, but rather the quickest, most accurate, and most effective system for measuring "what people are willing to pay for a given thing at a given moment." This is all that the free market does —  provides us with information.

To obtain this crowd-sourced measurement of value, the free market requires a social system which permit individuals to choose for themselves their means of employment, what they wish to have and accomplish, and to freely exchange their products of labor with one another. Without these, the measurement is distorted.

In practice, our markets aren’t free: certain businesses are not allowed to fail (bailouts); certain industries are price controlled (rent ceilings); certain goods are barred and restricted (tariffs). Then there’s excessive taxation, cronyism, and all the other delights of modern politic.

> It is the duty of every politically informed and engaged person to do everything he or she can to prevent politics.

Part history, part theory, and part autobiography, Don't Vote offers a 10,000-foot view on O'Rourke's understanding of political theory, and a 10-foot view on how it impacted him personally.

## Dracula
<div>
Dracula is an 1897 horror novel by Bram Stoker. It introduced the Count Dracula character and is told through diary entries, letters, and newspaper clippings.

The opening chapters detail a lawyer who visits Transylvania and slowly discovers that he’s essentially become a prisoner to Count Dracula, who sleeps in dirt and slithers down walls. Good stuff.

After that it gets a little boring, with passengers mysteriously disappearing on a ship headed to England. Surprise, it’s Dracula.

Then it gets really boring, as we learn about marriage proposals between two slags. The only saving grace is an apparent psychotic in a local ward who first collects then eats insects, spiders, birds, and rats.

One of the slags gets sick and dies, despite lots of garlic. Turns out her death was due to Dracula, and some gent named Val Helsing teaches them how to fight the vampire, which involves inoculating the boxes of special dirt that Dracula has to sleep in at night.

The remaining slag is forced to drink Dracula’s blood so he can control her, but the heroes turn that against Dracula and use her hysteria to track him down. Apparently he took a box of his special dirt back to Transylvania.

Once in Transylvania, the heroes evade some gypsies protecting the Count and somehow manage to kill him with a knife to the heart. The slag recovers and they agree they won’t be able to convince others of their story.
</div>

## Dubliners
<div>
Dubliners is a 1914 novella by James Joyce. It is comprised of fifteen short stories (chapters) set in Dublin, Ireland.

It's a hard one to categorize since the stories aren't really connected. Some chapters are more interesting than others. Joyce's first major publication, it's less cohesive than his latter novels which contain clearer storylines and styles; but since it's Joyce, it has its critical defenders.

At least as of last reading, its commensurable with _A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man_ in entertainment value. Good for good characters and quick reads.
</div>

## The Fountainhead
<div>
The Fountainhead is a 1943 novel by Ayn Rand.

The protagonist is Howard Roark, a young architect beholden to no industry standards. A secondary protagonist, Dominique Francon, is a love interest who wavers between supporting Howard or his former classmate Peter Keating, an architectural rival.

Howard works at some reputable architectural firm but is continually fired for being too creative or refusing to build in dated styles. Newspaperman and socialist Ellsworth M. Toohey smears Howard in his paper for bucking the traditional order and playing by his own rules.

Howard is sued for malpractice after an eccentric codger is dissatisfied with Howard's design work. The trial is a mockery of justice, with characters testifying against him for basically being an individualist who refuses to follow the stuffy rules of the architectural establishment.

His love interest Dominique marries his rival Keating, even though she knows that Howard possesses greatness, in consolation and resignation of the sad fact that the world does not exalt and encourage genius as it should. Keating basically sells her to potential client Gail Wynand in order to secure a commission; Dominique ends up marrying him, and Gail actually likes Howard's work.

Keating reaches out to Howard for help designing a project on Howard's terms -- that he remains anonymous and the plans are constructed exactly as designed. The promise is broken, and Howard illegally dynamites the entires construction for breach of contract.

Howard is arrested, and although Wynand tries to defend Howard in his papers at first, he eventually gives in and denounces Howard as well. On trial again, Howard gives an impassioned speech on integrity and individual character and is found not guilty.

Dominique ends up marrying Howard, and Howard designs a new skyscraper for Wynand, who himself finally realized that Howard possesses all the strengths that he (Wynand) thought he himself had. Howard is vindicated, without compromising his standards, creative vision, or imitating lesser artists than himself.

## Heart of Darkness
<div>
Heart of Darkness is an 1899 novella by Joseph Conrad. It is a story of conquest and imperialism in Africa, and was loosely adapted by Francis Ford Coppola’s into the Vietnam war film Apocalypse Now.

Charles Marlow, a sailor on the River Thames, tells his shipmates a story about working for an ivory trading company. He tells of his journey upon winding rivers into the heart of Africa, where he meets an accountant who tells him about a very successful tradesman named Kurtz, who runs a key trading post and delivers more ivory than any other tradesman for the company.

After a long trek inland, Marlow learns that the steamboat he's supposed to command has been damaged. The manager on site tells Marlow that Kurtz has fallen ill and that his station might be at risk. Months pass as they begin repairs on a separate boat, and a brick-maker tells Marlow more of the legend of Kurtz -- that he is a "prodigy" and a beacon of progress for the continent.

Once the ship is repaired, it's another two months up river. Finally nearing the station, they awaken one foggy morning to arrows being shot at them from ashore, with one of his crewmen falling to a spear. Marlow uses the steam whistle to scare away the attackers and finally reaches Kurtz's station.

They land at the station and learn from a stray Russian that the native savages worship Kurtz; that Kurtz is a warrior poet. Severed heads are impaled on posts around the station, and the natives carry Kurtz upon a stretcher to the steamboat. Once he's been loaded on, Marlow finally learns the opposite side to Kurtz's legend -- that the company wants to remove him from the station; that his methods have hurt the business and its reputation.

In the middle of the night, Marlow catches Kurtz crawling back ashore. They bring him back aboard and leave the station the next morning, firing upon the natives as they part. Kurtz gives Marlow some documents and a photograph, asking him not to show their contents to the manager. As Kurtz dies aboard the steamboat, his final words are a faint whisper, "The horror! The horror!"

Marlow falls ill the next day but recovers. When he's returned to Europe, Marlow is disillusioned with the modern world. He provides a journalist with Kurtz's documents and goes to visit Kurtz's fiancee. She pleads Marlow to tell her more about how Kurtz passed, to share his final words. Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz's parting word was her name.

## Heretics
<div>
Heretics is a 1905 collection of essays by G. K. Chesterton. It contains arguments against popular ideas by fashionable and/or contemporary authors of his day.

Chesterton begins with a defense of terminology, with orthodox traditionally being an adjective for correct. He suggests that even the most extreme partisans like violent anarchists must consider themselves orthodox to be morally justified in their actions.

> Orthodox: Right, correct, true; in accordance with what is accepted or authoritatively established as the true view or right practice. — Oxford English Dictionary, accessed May 8, 2020.

He laments that in modern society everything seems to matter except that which is most practical and important —  a man's view of the universe: "A man's opinions on tramcars matters; his opinion on Boticelli matters; his opinion on all things does not matter... [for] the modern idea is that cosmic truth is so unimportant that it cannot matter what any one says."

He argues that we seem to talk of everything except the essential questions, such as "What is good?" and "What is the good of being a man?" The need for ever more "progress" is on the tip of everyone's tongue, and yet, what is this "progress" we speak of — if we know not, truly, what we're progressing from, leaving behind, or what we really need to become our best selves?

Chesterton attempts to peel back our conventional use of language to reveal the hidden beauty and mystery of the world, the sacred hiding in the profane. Even something as simple as a control station to coordinate train movements holds a depth of meaning. In the material, it is an electronic system for toggling colored lights; but in the poetical, "it is a place where men, in an agony of vigilance, light blood-red and sea-green fires to keep other men from death."

Without intending to, for the word "conservative" appears no where near the following quote, Chesterton lays out one of the most sincere and simple explanations of the conservative impulse: "The moment we care for anything deeply, the world —  that is, all the other miscellaneous interests —  becomes our enemy."

He goes on to argue that the cosmopolitan, the traveler, the global citizen lives in a smaller world, in some sense, than the local townsman. The argument isn't particularly convincing, with the traveler noticing all the differences between people & places and the townsman focusing on similarities, but he builds on the idea later by suggesting that the traveler lives in a smaller ideological world because they're able to find and congregate with like-minded people and their movement permits them to live unattached to community, whereas the townsman has no choice but to accept and live alongside his neighbors no matter their creed.

In his chapter on Shaw, Chesterton emphasizes that to compare man to der übermensch or a transhuman future or any other progressive ideal is to lose sight of the very thing in front of you —  man in all his natural splendor, and beauty.

> It is not seeing things as they are to start with a vision of Argus with his hundred eyes, and then jeer at every man with two eyes as if he had only one. And it is not seeing things as they are to imagine a demi-god of infinite mental clarity, who may or may not appear in the latter days of the earth, and then to see all men as idiots... When we really see men as they are, we do not criticise, but worship; and very rightly. For a monster with mysterious eyes and miraculous thumbs, with strange dreams in his skull, and a queer tenderness for this place or that baby, is truly a wonderful and unnerving matter.

Chesterton defends ritual as older than human thought; it arises from in feeling the nature of things that there are certain proper things to say and do.

In his chapter on Moore, Chesterton digs into the "formal doctrine of the sin of pride": it is solitary, not social; it desires the applause of itself, not an audience; it inserts itself where it doesn't belong. While Alfred Korzybski & Robert Anton Wilson would applaud the following quote, Chesterton is speaking not of recognizing the distinction between perception & reality, but rather of the ego's insistence to draw focus upon itself.

> And he intrudes the capital "I" even where it need not be intruded —  even where it weakens the force of a plain statement. Where another man would say, "It is a fine day," Mr. Moore says, "Seen through my temperament, the day appeared fine." Where another man would say,"Milton has obviously a fine style," Mr. Moore would say, "As a stylist Milton had always impressed me."

There's other interesting stuff too. The end.

## Journey to the Center of the Earth
<div>
Journey to the Center of the Earth is an 1864 novel by Jules Verne. It follows three explorers on their journey into an inactive volcano in Iceland, where they discover creatures of the prehistoric world still live.

An orphaned young lad joins his eccentric mineralogist uncle to retrace the steps of an earlier explorer who allegedly found a route into the center of the earth. They prep materials, fly to Iceland, get a guide and climb down into a volcano. They trek deeper and deeper underground.

For three chapters they're thirsty for water, and then they find some water. Eventually they come upon a subterranean ocean. Crossing it, they see ancient dinosaurs fighting below them, then they're shipwrecked -- but still with enough supplies to go on.

They explore the shore, see some tall prehistoric man trotting about, some skeletons, the usual. After finding their route caved in, they use some dynamite and accidentally unleash the water around them. The floods shoot them up and up and eventually out of Etna (a different volcano).

All are alive, and are well-esteemed in society.

## Latter-Day Pamphlets
<div>
Latter-Day Pamphlets is an 1850 collection of essays ("pamphlets") by Thomas Carlyle. The eight essays are commentaries on political, religious, and social issues.

**No. 1. The Present Time**

On the (relatively) recent history of overthrowing kings and throwning democracy.

**No. 2. Model Prisons**

On how exemplary the prison system functions; how it's sustained at the tax payers' expense; and an argument that the "cosmic law of justice" is, underneath all, revenge.

**No. 3. Downing Street**

On current public leaders being unfit for service; wasteful and incompetent bureaucracies; and that an aristocratic model is the best means to employing competent governors.

**No. 4. The New Downing Street**

On his model government where the most able serve; on the unlikeliness of finding these most able individuals through universal suffrage; and an alternative model of government which is basically an unelected aristocracy with elections for nominal positions only.

**No. 5. Stump-Orator**

On the centrality of speech and language to the human experience; on society valuing slick lips over virtues; and on the ability of the ruling class to talk eloquent without really saying anything at all.

**No. 6. Parliaments**

On legislative bodies; how they’'e become the true sovereign of nations; how they talk and talk and talk while the real debates are held in the public square and by printing press.

**No. 7. Hudson's Statue**

On a proposed statue to Oliver Crowell; on how far virtue and heroes have fallen; on the public's worship of unworthy figures.

**No. 8. Jesuitism**

Not included in e-Book, so this section remains unread.

## Moby Dick: or, The Whale
<div>
Moby Dick; or, The Whale is an 1851 novel by Herman Melville. It's a story about an obsessive ship captain chasing a white sperm whale.

The book was unsuccessful during Melville's lifetime but is since reknown. It was inspired by an actual albino whale named Mocha Dick, as well as the unrelated whaleship Essex, which was sunk by a sperm whale and whose survivors resorted to cannibalism to stay alive.

Some of the most interesting parts, contrary to some popular opinion, are those interludes with actual historical information about whales and whaling. As a bygone era, and one uncommonly referenced today, the culture, traditions, and history of whales and the whaling industry are surprisingly rich, and the animals themselves undeniably impressive.

Yes, there is a captain named Ahab and a long, long whale chase. And sure, maybe it's an allegory for the dangers inherent in any obsessive, uncompromising pursuit. But it's still an exciting journey and a fascinating slice of history.
</div>

## Modern Manners
<div>
Modern Manners: An Etiquette Book for Rude People is a 1994 book by P. J. O'Rourke.

There's something about the folly of politics that brings out the best in O'Rourke -- this, however, is a book on manners. It features his routine wit but just doesn't punch quite like his other work.

When O'Rourke talks politics, there's always kernels of truth among the giggles. But Modern Manners is different. It's snark for snark's sake.

Really, he just rags on "polite" society. Not actual polite people, but the crusty, image-conscious, blue-blooded gentry. But everyone already knows those folk are the walking, talking dead -- predictably self-righteous and boring.

For actual books on manners, see _The Curmudgeon's Guide to Getting Ahead_ by Charles Murray or the GentleManners series by John Bridges.

## The Most Dangerous Book
<div>
The Most Dangerous Book is a non-fiction book by Kevin Birmingham about the publication of James Joyce's Ulysses. Unlike other major works on Joyce or his works, Birmingham focuses on the obscenity trials surrounding the publication of Ulysses in the United States of America ("the states").

There were at least three cases concerning Ulysses in the states. The first over the Comstock Act of 1873, the second over the Tariff Act of 1930, and the third an appeal over the second.

**1921: The Little Review**

In 1921, The Little Review was found guilty of violating the Comstock obscenity laws for serializing Ulysses. In particular, it was due to their publication of the Nausicaa episode -- wherein it is alluded that Bloom masturbates to a woman at the beach. An attorney in New York, whose daughter received the issue unsolicited in the mail, brought the issue to the Society for the Suppression of Vice, who later filed a formal complaint.

Ultimately, the two publishers (Margaret Caroline Anderson and Jane Heap) were found guilty of violation of the Comstock Act of 1873. They were levied a $100 fine and ceased publication of Ulysses. During the trial, one of the judges allegedly said that "[The episode] sound[ed] to [him] like the ravings of a disordered mind," and that he couldn't "see why anyone would want to publish it."

The verdict ended the serialization of Ulysses in the states, and official publications wouldn't be made available until 1933. The effective banning of the novel, unsurprisingly, generated new interest in the work. Unofficial bootleg publications circulated, most notably by a publisher named Samuel Roth. Though Roth's publication was supposedly a protest against censorship, Joyce never received any compensation, the editions introduced typographical errors, and other authors issued a public letter against Roth for theft and corruption of the text.

**1933: United States v. One Book Called "Ulysses"**

Random House owned the rights to publish Ulysses in the states but didn't believe they could publish it due the previous ruling against The Little Review. So, they schemed. In 1932, in order to trigger a test case (designed to set precedent), Random House imported Ulysses from France and intentionally tipped off U.S. Customs about the shipment. When Customs failed to confiscate the shipment upon its arrival, an attorney for Random House delivered the package to Customs and demanded they confiscate it. They did.

The Southern District of New York (SDNY) heard the case, with Random House seeking to dismiss the states's action to seize and destroy the works for obscenity under the Tariff Act of 1930. The case was presided over by Judge John M. Woolsey. Some points of note are that Woolsey:

* Determined that a trial by jury was unfeasable, due to the length and difficulty of Ulysses.
* Read Ulysses in its entirety before adjudicating, and admitted that the study of Ulysses is "a heavy task."
* Did not consider the work "obscene" as defined by the courts ("tending to stir the sex impulses").
* Understood the work to be "a serious experiment in a new, if not wholly novel, literary genre."
* Considered the work "brilliant and dull, intelligible and obscure, by turns," and that he did not find "anything that [he] considered to be dirt for dirt's sake."

Judge Woolsey dismissed the case and declared that "Ulysses may, therefore, be admitted into the United States."

**1934: United States v. One Book Entitled Ulysses by James Joyce**

The verdict was appealed to the Second Circuit and heard by three judges: Martin Manton, the awesomely named Learned Hand, and Hand's slightly less awesomely named cousin Augustus Noble Hand. The Hands upheld the prior ruling, with Manton dissenting.

Manton's dissent was due to Joyce's alleged transgressions against noble moral standards. He asserted that certain pages were "too indecent to add as a footnote to [his] opinion," that it was "written for alleged amusement of the reader only," and that it was "art for art's sake" rather than "art for the people's service."

Noble Hand wrote the majority opinion. Like Woolsey, he praised Ulysses and Joyces style, stating that:

* Joyce "may be regarded as a pioneer among those writers who have adopted the ‘stream of consciousness' method of presenting fiction.
* Ulysses is rated as a book of considerable power by persons whose opinions are entitled to weight.
* Certain passages "are of beauty and undoubted distinction, while others are of a vulgarity that is extreme."
* "Joyce... has dealt with 'things unattempted yet in prose or rime.'" [sic]
* "Page after page of the book is, or seems to be, incomprehensible."
* "In numerous places there are found originality, beauty, and distinction... while in not a few spots it is coarse, blasphemous, and obscene."

The Hands handed the verdict thus. Random House was free to publish James Joyce's Ulysses, and precedent is now such that obscenity adjudications should consider, among other things, the entire work rather than excerpts.

## The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana
<div>
The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is a 2004 novel by Umberto Eco. It's about a man with memory loss trying to piece his life history together through family artifacts.

Giambattista "Yambo" Bodoni awakens in a hospital with no memory of self. Lyrics, book passages and quotations, cultural expressions are all that remain readily available to him. He learns he is married, has grandchildren, and is an antiquarian book dealer. At his wife's encouragement, he travels alone to his family’s old country estate to see if the house, and the abandoned possessions within, can help conjure up any real sense of his identity.

For over a week he explores old books in the attic, much of which seems like an excuse for the author to go on Joycean, list-making tangents detailing many forgotten 20th-century cultural artifacts -- artwork featured on old metal tins, children's books which had Italian identities interjected into the characters when the stories were imported into Fascist Italy, etc. Some interesting cultural history, but of no real consequence to the plot.

Despite spending over a week at the estate, there's somehow always another box he hasn't looked through yet. That lets the author reminisce on growing up under Il Duce, which in turn lets Yambo question how he felt about it all. The reader is subjected to pages of cringe teen poetry and learns that Yambo's grandfather poured a vial of feces down a fascist's throat and bragged to him about it the next morning. Eventually, we learn that as a teenager Yambo fell in love with a girl, was basically a creep over the way he obsessed on her, and that she died aged 18 shortly after moving from town. He had only learned of her death and real name (Savilla) shortly before the amnesia and can't recall her face

Again, somehow, there's still another box he hasn't gone through. The last box, and -- surprise! -- it contains an original First Folio of Shakespeare's works, which can gross over $6,000,000 at auction. Then everything goes black and Yambo is pure mind. His best guess is that he lies in a coma, having suffered another stroke at the shock of discovering the book, but the good news is that his memory starts flooding back to him.

Yambo's mind is adrift in no-place and no-time. Ideas and memories surface. Some even seem real -- that is, his. A cascade of characters from film and comic books march across his mind. He is getting closer to the one thing he wants -- to see Savilla's face. He knows she was an instrumental figure in him becoming who he was -- whomever that is -- as she was imprinted forever into his nervous system as a young, impressionable teenage boy. Yes, she is the answer. She is the key that will unlock the mystery of his identity. The cascade of characters continues their ceremonial march across his consciousness until, finally, she is up next. As she's about to appear, all goes black.

## Notes from Underground
<div>
Notes from Underground is an 1864 novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky. It is an early example of an existentialist novel.

The novel isn't high art but it does hold up, and the depiction of the unnamed protagonist is unfortunately all too relevant today. He's angsty, emo, bitter, whiny, cringey, arrogant, and egocentric. Basically, he's a redditor.
</div>

## Parliament of Whores
<div>
Parliament of Whores is a 1991 book by P. J. O’Rourke that satirizes the U.S. government.

P.J. breaks down the daily on the U.S. government. There's the three branches, where all are incompetent. There's the extended bureaucracy, where all are incompetent. And there's government spending, where all is wasted.

With the structure & financing of the federal government established, P.J. peeks into policy. What, exactly, does government buy with its spending? Turns out, not much. They waste money on drug policy, poverty initiatives, farm subsidies, and foreign aid.

Then he mocks public protests, the economics of radical ecologists, and the U.S. government’s most entitled entitlement program, Social Security.

It's classic P.J. -- incisive, irreverent, and now irrelevant. Most of the stories and statistics have aged with the tide of time, but still worth a chuckle. And for better or worse, P.J.'s description of incompetent and wasteful government spending is a quaint, bygone memory of better days -- better days where incompetent and wasteful government spending was less incompetent and wasteful than it is today.
</div>

## The Prague Cemetary
<div>
The Prague Cemetary is a 2010 novel by Umberto Eco.

Simone Simoni, lawyer-plagiarist, goes on exciting and antisemitic escapades across 19th-century Europe.

Simoni learned from his grandfather at an early age that the French Revolution, Knights Templar, and Weishaupt's Illuminati were all marionettes dancing from sweaty, swarthy Jewish fingers. Furthermore, everything wrong or suspect in the world is the direct or indirect result of the inescapable Jewish instinct to undermine their host nations. Seek, and ye shall find.

This ugly, unhappy man is recruited as an asset by the Kingdom of Sardinia (RIP) to gin up forgeries on behalf of, or to further the interests of, their "intelligence" agencies. He's basically a grand wizard at everything -- forgery, double-agency, and even personality disorder.

Somewhere along the way, Abbe Dalla Piccola, one of the alter-egos he used to infiltrate sources, becomes a split personality. The novel is mostly a serious of written correspondences between Simoni and his other half, Piccola, as they try to piece together the history of their lives and how they're interconnected.

There is, however, no great resolve to the many conflicts presented herein. Simoni realizes he is Piccola, and vice versa, and they live happily together as one entity again. But the reader receives no grand conclusion to their story. Simoni is just on a path, though not explicitly stated, to piece together his magnum opus -- an amalgamation of his greatest antisemitic forgeries into the infamous Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

And that's sort of it. A story of 19th-century cultural and political undercurrents, told through a mentally unstable forger, as the author’s explanations for how the Protocols of the Elders of Zion might have been written. Altogether a crude and disconnected, sometimes fun, hypothetical in novel form.
</div>

## Treasure Island
<div>
Treasure Island is an 1883 novel by Robert Louis Stevenson. It is an adventure story about searching for pirate's buried treasure.

It's a cute story filled with tropes, but at least seems to have helped create some of those tropes itself. X-marks-the-spot, the one-legged Long John Silver, yadda yadda.

It makes a fine adventure novel for young adults. Similar to _Journey to the Center of the Earth_, it's not particularily thrilling, interesting, or well-written, but it's fun enough.
</div>

## Ulysses
<div>
Ulysses is a 1922 novel by Irish author James Joyce. The 730 page story takes place on June 16, 1904, in Dublin, Ireland. The chapters are unnamed, but have since been identified by scholars as mapping to Homer's Odyssey, such that the characters and events in the novel correspond to different parts of Odysseus's journey from Troy back to Ithaca.

The three main characters are Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly, and his friend Stephen Dedalus. The story is of their ordinary day in Dublin -- conversations, eaves-droppings, disagreements, estrangements, drunken escapades -- from the morning's first shave to crawling back into bed.

The chapters jump between different characters across Dublin, with Joyce utilizing a stream-of-consciousness style to simulate their thought processes and inner monologue. The characters often intersect and interact with each other throughout the day.

It is notorious for its reputation as being one of the most difficult novels to read, with Joyce remarking that "it will keep the professors busy for centuries arguing over what I meant." It is also notable for being subjected to an obscenity trial in the U.S. for heretical and sexual references.

The novel is celebrated annually as Bloomsday in major cities worldwide every June 16th, but especially in Dublin, where radio performances, street readings, and tours of the novel's locations take place.

## Unlimited Memory
<div>
Unlimited Memory is a 2014 book by Kevin Horsley. It describes mental tricks to improve memory and retention.

Kevin Horsley is a "Grandmaster of Memory" who ranks in the top 1,000 worldwide across multiple memory "disciplines.” He holds the second fastest time in the "Everest" of memory tests, which measures how fast participants can recite random selections of 5-digit chunks within the first 10,000 digits of pi.

The first tip is not to multitask. Multitasking is less efficient since it takes time for the brain to switch between tasks. Practice "consecutive tasking" instead of "simultaneous tasking."

The second tip is to be interested in the material, even if you need to feign curiosity. Having a specific purpose for learning some material, and being interested in learning it, improves concentration and increases the amount of information retained (read: duh).

The main tip or trick, though, is to create strong, unique word associations and visual stories for what you wish to memorize.

> Canberra, Australia: Imagine a kangaroo (which represents Australia) eating a can of berries. 

> Athens, Greece: Imagine eight hens swimming in grease... Imagine a silly picture... [Bring] information to life with your endless imagination.

**Car/Body Method**

The car method or body method can be used to memorize unordered lists. It involves placing your unique, creative visual associations onto some physical object you know well, such as your car or your body.

> See your car in your mind. Imagine squeezing a big apple into the front grille. Take a carrot and stab it into the hood. On the windshield, see grainy bread, and think to yourself, "That grainy bread is going to damage my wipers..."

**Rhyming Peg Method**

The rhyming pegs method can be used to memorize ordered lists. Associate the numbers one through ten with rhyming nouns -- come up with these for yourself so the association is stronger, e.g. gun or nun for one, shoe or tattoo for two. Then "peg" an item to that numeric association.

> [Item Ten (hen): Contribution:] Imagine a hen giving you presents. She is a "contributing hen." Ten is therefore contribution.

**Spaces in Places Method**

The spaces in places method is the mind palace technique of linking visual associations with familiar spatial environments. This method dates back to the turn of the first millennium and is the most famous memorization technique. Ancient texts that discuss the method (e.g. Rhetorica ad Herennium) recommend adding visual, auditory, and other sensory details to strengthen the associations.

The core idea is that you use a room, a house, a particular drive, some physical space that you know well and associate the items to memorize with different objects or landmarks in this space. To recall the items, you simply walk through the space and activate the desired items into memory.

**Linking Thought Method**

The linking thoughts method is one in which you build a story out of your associations. Items to memorize are therefore linked together through some narrative. The example used by Horsley in the book involves U.S. presidents -- while you're washing a tin, it grows an Adam's apple. A chef and her son walk by and rip it out to make some medicine to give to Marilyn Monroe...

Horsley provides some tips for remember names, such as by inventing some association with a person you already know by that name, or linking them to a particular physical characteristic of the person. But the most important part of this tip is simply to pay attention -- actually listen and attempt to retain the person’s name when they introduce themselves.

## War and Peace
<div>
War and Peace is an 1869 novel by Leo Tolstoy. It is a 15-year saga (1805-1820) chronicling the lives of five aristocratic families through Napoleon's failed invasion of the Russian Empire in 1812.

A lesser individual might've called it Soldiers and Soirees.

Basically, posh society watches Napoleon's conquest with amusement until it's at their back door. War rages, a million people die, and Napoleon goes home. The war leads all in both high society and war to either die or mature.

It's a historical novel with detailed musings on the inner motivations and fears of the main characters. The novel is also interspersed with chapters on Tolstoy's philosophy of historiography, which denounces the "great man theory" in favor of one in which divine providence and the collective, compounding actions of thousands of unremarkable individuals ultimately drive the destinies of the so-called "great men" nominally in charge of making decisions.

The story features hundreds of characters but the most primary is Pierre, who (arguably) most closely resembles Tolstoy among the entire cast. In the story, Pierre is a moderately-willed effeminate intellectual whose story progresses from admiring Napoleon and revolution to despairing in love, to meaning in freemasonry, to disillusionment in man’s constant material pursuits, to nihilism, to desperation, to blind courage, to transcending his fear of death, to finding meaning in the smallest of moments, and to his ultimate fulfillment in marriage and fatherhood. Both Pierre and Tolstoy were born in aristocracy; both tried to define themselves without it; both were pacifists; and both found meaning in the minuscule.

It is an ambitious study of the mind, the human spirit, and the material. A study of the ego, the will, and the world, at odds and in harmony.
