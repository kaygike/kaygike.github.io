## 2001: A Space Odyssey

2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 novel by Arthur C. Clarke developed concurrently with the Stanley Kubrick film of the same name.

_Part I. Primeval Night._ Early man struggles to survive. They encounter a “New Rock” (Africus Monolith, e.g. TMA-0) which stimulates new mental activity, slowly leading to their development of more advanced tools and greater dominance over nature.

_Part 2. TMA-1._ A quarantine on the moon is a cover story for a recent discovery nicknamed TMA-1, or the Tycho [crater] Magnetic Anomaly-1. TMA-1 is a black rectangular monolith dated 3,000,000 years old, found buried on the moon. It is the first evidence of extra-terrestrial intelligence, and emits five bursts of electronic shrieks while under investigation.

_Part 3. Between Planets._ Five astronauts head towards Saturn on the Discovery spacecraft, guided by an artificially intelligent computer named HAL 9000. Three of the astronauts are in hibernation, and they pass Jupiter en route.

_Part 4. Abyss._ HAL 9000 continually detects a malfunction in a critical communication device, even after one of the crew members replaces it. As ground control suggests that HAL 9000 itself may be malfunctioning, the device “fails” and communication with Earth is lost. Attempting to replace the device yet again, the pod abruptly changes position and knocks the crew member into deep space. HAL 9000 takes control of the ship and kills three of the remaining four crew members by opening the airlock while they’re sedated in hibernation. HAL 9000 is protecting the true, classified purpose of the mission – to explore a moon of Saturn suspected to be the origin of the TMA-1 monolith – before he is disconnected by the sole remaining crew member, Dave.

_Part 5. The Moons of Saturn._ Dave continues towards Saturn as a lone ambassador from Earth. He spots a larger version of TMA-1 on its surface, which was placed there 3,000,000 years ago by intelligent, extraterrestrial, extra-spatial life. As Dave nears Saturn’s monolith, the monolith unfolds spacetime absorbs Dave’s ship into its abyss. Dave senses he’s moving at incredible speed and believes the monolith to be some sort of “star gate” that facilitates faster-than-light travel. His pod lands in what appears to be an ordinary hotel room, prepared for someone of his species to eventually discover. He sleeps, relives his past, and is transformed into an extra-spatial omnipotent being (“Star-Child”) with the power to influence matter and help guide mankind through a new stage of evolution.


## The Brothers Karamazov

The Brothers Karamazov is an 1880 philosophical novel by Fyodor Dostoevsky. It tells the story of four brothers and the murder of their father.

Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is a selfish codger with four sons by three mothers.

The eldest son, Dmitri (Mitya), is a "bad Catholic" -- or what some simply call "Catholic." Specific theologies aside, Dmitri is a sinner seeking salvation. He does bad, but seeks good. He succumbs to his basest, primal impulses, yet occasionally manages to deny them in pursuit of spiritual redemption. He is a man, flaws and all. Dmitri's central conflicts with his father involve a love triangle with a younger woman and an inheritance from his mother which he hasn’t access to.

The middle son, Ivan (Vanya), is the intellectual. He is analytical, calculated, and deeply concerned with human suffering. He could be a brilliant theologian if only he could reconcile the existence of human suffering with a belief in God, but alas, he cannot. Ivan would rather be wrong but win a debate than be right and lose a debate. He's a showman who loves exposing contradictions but, because he cannot logically solve life's great questions, doesn't live a particularly joyful life. His words inadvertently lead to Fyodor’s murder and Dmitri’s unjust condemnation.

The youngest son, Alexei (Alyosha), is the faithful one. He studies beneath Father Zosima, who encourages him to gain experience in the real world before cloistering himself in a monastery. He is loving, forgiving, and naive. Alexei loves his brothers, as he loves all, and occasionally helps them moderate their sinful pursuits. He tutors young children in moral character and faith, and ultimately redeems the Karamazov name so tainted by his father.

The rejected son, Smerdyakov (Pavel), is an epileptic bastard. He serves as Fyodor's house servant. He is the son of "Reeking Lizaveta", a mute who died in childbirth after (allegedly) getting knocked up by Fyodor. Smerdyakov tortured animals growing up. He love-hates his father and loves his brother Ivan. His actions advertently lead to Fyodor's murder and inadvertently to Ivan's mental breakdown.

_Book I._ The novel starts with an introduction to the family.

_Books II & III._ They visit Father Zosima to help mediate the dispute over the inheritance from Dmitri's mother, but to no avail. There is a deeper conflict beneath it all -- Fyodor and Dmitri are in love with the same woman.

_Book IV._ Alyosha tries to help a schoolboy who's being bullied, but ends up apologizing to the boy’s father for Dmitri's past behavior.

_Book V._ Ivan jests with Alyosha over his faith, and launches into a long poem titled The Grand Inquisitor. In the poem, Jesus returns during the Spanish inquisition, is imprisoned, and is chastised for his decision to grant free will to man, as that responsibility was too great a burden and led to human suffering. In response, Jesus kisses his prison guard and is released. Upon hearing the poem, Alyosha kisses his brother Ivan.

_Book VI._ Father Zosima recounts his life story, and explains his belief that everyone shares responsibility for their neighbors' sins.

_Book VII._ Father Zosima dies and his body decomposes, disappointing many who believe that the bodies of holy men don't decompose in death. Alyosha mourns his mentor and ventures back into the world, per Father Zosima's earlier instructions.

_Book VIII._ Dmitri stalks outside of his father Fyodor's house, suspecting that the woman whom they both love went to visit his father. He carries a brass pestle. Time flashes forward and Dmitri flees the property, knocking a servant out along the way. Dmitri gets drunk while covered in blood and carrying a wad of money, and is subsequently arrested for the murder of Fyodor.

_Book IX._ Dmitri is interrogated. He admits to striking the servant, but denies murdering his father and refuses to explain how he came into money. This is complicated by the fact that money went missing from Fyodor's house upon the murder. The only other possible suspect is Smerdyakov, but he was in an epileptic fit when the murder occurred. For lack of better explanation and Dmitri's refusal to disclose how he acquired the money, he is formally charged and imprisoned.

_Book X._ A friend of the schoolboy met earlier in Book IV is growing up to be a smart-ass atheist, like Ivan. Alyosha challenges the boy's nihilism.

_Book XI._ Ivan meets three times with Smerdyakov and eventually learns the Smerdyakov is the murderer. Smerdyakov admits to faking an epileptic fit and murdering their father. He offers Ivan the stolen money and explains that he never would’ve murdered the old man were it not for Ivan, for it was through Ivan whom Smerdyakov learned that all is permissible and that religious morality is herd mentality. Ivan is horrified by the impact of his words and suffers a mental breakdown. The devil visits him in hallucinations and mocks his beliefs. Smerdyakov commits suicide without confessing to anyone else, and intentionally omits his responsibility for the murder from his suicide note.

_Book XII._ A mockery of trial finds Dmitri guilty. Ivan remains tormented by guilt, and has yet to recover from his mental breakdown.

_Epilogue._ Dmitri accepts his fate. There's talk of an escape plan and he reconciles with one of his former lovers who falsely accused him during the trial. But no escape is to be witnessed. Instead, Alyosha leads a funeral service for a young schoolboy recently departed. He implores the children to love deep and wide, to forgive all, and to cherish every moment and memory they have. The boys are enraptured by his speech, and end the novel cheering "Hurrah for Karamazov." In Alyosha, the Karamazov family name has been redeemed.


## Bushido: The Soul of Japan

Bushido: The Soul of Japan is a 1900 book by Inazo Nitobé. It is an explanation and musing for western audiences of the character, ethics, and history of the Japanese samurai.

According to author Inazo Nitobé, _Bu-shi-do_ translates to _Military-Knight-Ways_ —  the character, teachings, ethics, and chivalry of Japanese sword-warriors. The system is simple: total allegiance to master, death for dishonor, sword as last resort, and honor over all. To die for an unworthy cause is cowardice; to slay an unworthy foe is murder.

For better or worse, samurai are depicted as the archetypal warrior-poet. He is stoic, steadfast, and dangerous, yet has self-control and lives in harmony with the dis/order of society. Nitobé defends old Japan from the ethical, political, and social criticism levied by the prevailing cultural hegemony (barbarism, imperialism, classism, sexism). The Japanese order is bound by a voluntary, self-imposed ethic of duty, honor, and restraint unknown to the West.

> "Only a pomegranate is he" —  so runs a popular saying —  "who, when he gapes his mouth, displays the contents of his heart."

_Seppuku_ or _kappuku_ (_hara-kiri_) was not mere suicide — it was ceremonial. The use of disembowelment was based on the ancient belief of the gut as the seat of the soul. Bearing it openly was an offering to view their innermost character for judgement.

> No one circle in the Inferno will boast of greater density of Japanese population than the seventh, to which Dante consigns all victims of self-destruction!

Bushido "set a moral standard for [the populace] and guided them by their example." Although it lives no longer as a system, it is immortal as a virtue. For "wherever man struggles to raise himself above himself, wherever his spirit masters his flesh by his own exertions, there we see the immortal discipline of Zeno at work."


## Don't Vote -- It Just Encourages the Bastards

Don’t Vote — It Just Encourages the Bastards is a 2010 book by P. J. O’Rourke. It describes the American politico-economic system and his personal journey from the left-wing to libertarianism.
Synopsis

For better or worse, this is one of P. J. O'Rourke's more serious books. He spends a fair amount of time on political theory, e.g. the U.S. model as one of free people consenting to being governed as opposed to governed people permitted to be "free," and the "pursuit of happiness" as an unparalleled unalienable right among the founding documents and constitutions of developed nations.

He also delights in delineating between negative and positive rights, or "get-outa-heres" and "gimmes." Negative rights are freedoms from or shall nots, whereas positive rights are for or rights to something (e.g. "shall not be infringed" vs. "shall enjoy the right to").

> Positive rights themselves, in turn, are absurdly expandable… Even negative rights aren’t free… But positive rights require no end of money.

One of O'Rourke's core theses is that the free market is not an economic ideology, per se, but rather the quickest, most accurate, and most effective system for measuring "what people are willing to pay for a given thing at a given moment." This is all that the free market does —  provides us with information.

To obtain this crowd-sourced measurement of value, the free market requires a social system which permit individuals to choose for themselves their means of employment, what they wish to have and accomplish, and to freely exchange their products of labor with one another. Without these, the measurement is distorted.

In practice, our markets aren’t free: certain businesses are not allowed to fail (bailouts); certain industries are price controlled (rent ceilings); certain goods are barred and restricted (tariffs). Then there’s excessive taxation, cronyism, and all the other delights of modern politic.

> It is the duty of every politically informed and engaged person to do everything he or she can to prevent politics.

Part history, part theory, and part autobiography, Don't Vote offers a 10,000-foot view on O'Rourke's understanding of political theory, and a 10-foot view on how it impacted him personally.


## Dracula

Dracula is an 1897 horror novel by Bram Stoker. It introduced the Count Dracula character and is told through diary entries, letters, and newspaper clippings.

The opening chapters detail a lawyer who visits Transylvania and slowly discovers that he’s essentially become a prisoner to Count Dracula, who sleeps in dirt and slithers down walls. Good stuff.

After that it gets a little boring, with passengers mysteriously disappearing on a ship headed to England. Surprise, it’s Dracula.

Then it gets really boring, as we learn about marriage proposals between two slags. The only saving grace is an apparent psychotic in a local ward who first collects then eats insects, spiders, birds, and rats.

One of the slags gets sick and dies, despite lots of garlic. Turns out her death was due to Dracula, and some gent named Val Helsing teaches them how to fight the vampire, which involves inoculating the boxes of special dirt that Dracula has to sleep in at night.

The remaining slag is forced to drink Dracula’s blood so he can control her, but the heroes turn that against Dracula and use her hysteria to track him down. Apparently he took a box of his special dirt back to Transylvania.

Once in Transylvania, the heroes evade some gypsies protecting the Count and somehow manage to kill him with a knife to the heart. The slag recovers and they agree they won’t be able to convince others of their story.


## Heretics

Heretics is a 1905 collection of essays by G. K. Chesterton. It contains arguments against popular ideas by fashionable and/or contemporary authors of his day.

Chesterton begins with a defense of terminology, with orthodox traditionally being an adjective for correct. He suggests that even the most extreme partisans like violent anarchists must consider themselves orthodox to be morally justified in their actions.

> Orthodox: Right, correct, true; in accordance with what is accepted or authoritatively established as the true view or right practice. — Oxford English Dictionary, accessed May 8, 2020.

He laments that in modern society everything seems to matter except that which is most practical and important —  a man's view of the universe: “"A man's opinions on tramcars matters; his opinion on Boticelli matters; his opinion on all things does not matter... [for] the modern idea is that cosmic truth is so unimportant that it cannot matter what any one says."

He argues that we seem to talk of everything except the essential questions, such as "What is good?" and "What is the good of being a man?" The need for ever more "progress" is on the tip of everyone's tongue, and yet, what is this "progress" we speak of — if we know not, truly, what we're progressing from, leaving behind, or what we really need to become our best selves?

Chesterton attempts to peel back our conventional use of language to reveal the hidden beauty and mystery of the world, the sacred hiding in the profane. Even something as simple as a control station to coordinate train movements holds a depth of meaning. In the material, it is an electronic system for toggling colored lights; but in the poetical, "it is a place where men, in an agony of vigilance, light blood-red and sea-green fires to keep other men from death."

Without intending to, for the word "conservative" appears no where near the following quote, Chesterton lays out one of the most sincere and simple explanations of the conservative impulse: "The moment we care for anything deeply, the world —  that is, all the other miscellaneous interests —  becomes our enemy."

He goes on to argue that the cosmopolitan, the traveler, the global citizen lives in a smaller world, in some sense, than the local townsman. The argument isn't particularly convincing, with the traveler noticing all the differences between people & places and the townsman focusing on similarities, but he builds on the idea later by suggesting that the traveler lives in a smaller ideological world because they're able to find and congregate with like-minded people and their movement permits them to live unattached to community, whereas the townsman has no choice but to accept and live alongside his neighbors no matter their creed.

In his chapter on Shaw, Chesterton emphasizes that to compare man to der übermensch or a transhuman future or any other progressive ideal is to lose sight of the very thing in front of you —  man in all his natural splendor, and beauty.

> It is not seeing things as they are to start with a vision of Argus with his hundred eyes, and then jeer at every man with two eyes as if he had only one. And it is not seeing things as they are to imagine a demi-god of infinite mental clarity, who may or may not appear in the latter days of the earth, and then to see all men as idiots... When we really see men as they are, we do not criticise, but worship; and very rightly. For a monster with mysterious eyes and miraculous thumbs, with strange dreams in his skull, and a queer tenderness for this place or that baby, is truly a wonderful and unnerving matter.

Chesterton defends ritual as older than human thought; it arises from in feeling the nature of things that there are certain proper things to say and do.

In his chapter on Moore, Chesterton digs into the "formal doctrine of the sin of pride": it is solitary, not social; it desires the applause of itself, not an audience; it inserts itself where it doesn't belong. While Alfred Korzybski & Robert Anton Wilson would applaud the following quote, Chesterton is speaking not of recognizing the distinction between perception & reality, but rather of the ego's insistence to draw focus upon itself.

> And he intrudes the capital "I" even where it need not be intruded —  even where it weakens the force of a plain statement. Where another man would say, "It is a fine day," Mr. Moore says, "Seen through my temperament, the day appeared fine." Where another man would say,"“Milton has obviously a fine style," Mr. Moore would say, "As a stylist Milton had always impressed me."

There's other interesting stuff too. The end.


## Journey to the Center of the Earth

Journey to the Center of the Earth is an 1864 novel by Jules Verne. It follows three explorers on their journey into an inactive volcano in Iceland, where they discover creatures of the prehistoric world still live.

An orphaned young lad joins his eccentric mineralogist uncle to retrace the steps of an earlier explorer who allegedly found a route into the center of the earth. They prep materials, fly to Iceland, get a guide and climb down into a volcano. They trek deeper and deeper underground.

For three chapters they're thirsty for water, and then they find some water. Eventually they come upon a subterranean ocean. Crossing it, they see ancient dinosaurs fighting below them, then they're shipwrecked -- but still with enough supplies to go on.

They explore the shore, see some tall prehistoric man trotting about, some skeletons, the usual. After finding their route caved in, they use some dynamite and accidentally unleash the water around them. The floods shoot them up and up and eventually out of Etna (a different volcano).

All are alive, and are well-esteemed in society.


## Latter-Day Pamphlets

Latter-Day Pamphlets is an 1850 collection of essays (“pamphlets”) by Thomas Carlyle. The eight essays are commentaries on political, religious, and social issues.

_No. 1. The Present Time._ On the (relatively) recent history of overthrowing kings and throwning democracy.

_No. 2. Model Prisons._ On how exemplary the prison system functions; how it's sustained at the tax payers' expense; and an argument that the "cosmic law of justice" is, underneath all, revenge.

_No. 3. Downing Street._ On current public leaders being unfit for service; wasteful and incompetent bureaucracies; and that an aristocratic model is the best means to employing competent governors.

_No. 4. The New Downing Street._ On his model government where the most able serve; on the unlikeliness of finding these most able individuals through universal suffrage; and an alternative model of government which is basically an unelected aristocracy with elections for nominal positions only.

_No. 5. Stump-Orator._ On the centrality of speech and language to the human experience; on society valuing slick lips over virtues; and on the ability of the ruling class to talk eloquent without really saying anything at all.

_No. 6. Parliaments._ On legislative bodies; how they’'e become the true sovereign of nations; how they talk and talk and talk while the real debates are held in the public square and by printing press.

_No. 7. Hudson's Statue._ On a proposed statue to Oliver Crowell; on how far virtue and heroes have fallen; on the public's worship of unworthy figures.

_No. 8. Jesuitism._ Not included in e-Book, so this section remains unread.


## Parliament of Whores

Parliament of Whores is a 1991 book by P. J. O’Rourke that satirizes the U.S. government.

P.J. breaks down the daily on the U.S. government. There's the three branches, where all are incompetent. There's the extended bureaucracy, where all are incompetent. And there's government spending, where all is wasted.

With the structure & financing of the federal government established, P.J. peeks into policy. What, exactly, does government buy with its spending? Turns out, not much. They waste money on drug policy, poverty initiatives, farm subsidies, and foreign aid.

Then he mocks public protests, the economics of radical ecologists, and the U.S. government’s most entitled entitlement program, Social Security.

It's classic P.J. -- incisive, irreverent, and now irrelevant. Most of the stories and statistics have aged with the tide of time, but still worth a chuckle. And for better or worse, P.J.'s description of incompetent and wasteful government spending is a quaint, bygone memory of better days -- better days where incompetent and wasteful government spending was less incompetent and wasteful than it is today.
