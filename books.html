<h2 id="a-space-odyssey">2001: A Space Odyssey</h2>
<p>2001: A Space Odyssey is a 1968 novel by Arthur C. Clarke developed
concurrently with the Stanley Kubrick film of the same name.</p>
<p><em>Part I. Primeval Night.</em> Early man struggles to survive. They
encounter a “New Rock” (Africus Monolith, e.g. TMA-0) which stimulates
new mental activity, slowly leading to their development of more
advanced tools and greater dominance over nature.</p>
<p><em>Part 2. TMA-1.</em> A quarantine on the moon is a cover story for
a recent discovery nicknamed TMA-1, or the Tycho [crater] Magnetic
Anomaly-1. TMA-1 is a black rectangular monolith dated 3,000,000 years
old, found buried on the moon. It is the first evidence of
extra-terrestrial intelligence, and emits five bursts of electronic
shrieks while under investigation.</p>
<p><em>Part 3. Between Planets.</em> Five astronauts head towards Saturn
on the Discovery spacecraft, guided by an artificially intelligent
computer named HAL 9000. Three of the astronauts are in hibernation, and
they pass Jupiter en route.</p>
<p><em>Part 4. Abyss.</em> HAL 9000 continually detects a malfunction in
a critical communication device, even after one of the crew members
replaces it. As ground control suggests that HAL 9000 itself may be
malfunctioning, the device “fails” and communication with Earth is lost.
Attempting to replace the device yet again, the pod abruptly changes
position and knocks the crew member into deep space. HAL 9000 takes
control of the ship and kills three of the remaining four crew members
by opening the airlock while they’re sedated in hibernation. HAL 9000 is
protecting the true, classified purpose of the mission – to explore a
moon of Saturn suspected to be the origin of the TMA-1 monolith – before
he is disconnected by the sole remaining crew member, Dave.</p>
<p><em>Part 5. The Moons of Saturn.</em> Dave continues towards Saturn
as a lone ambassador from Earth. He spots a larger version of TMA-1 on
its surface, which was placed there 3,000,000 years ago by intelligent,
extraterrestrial, extra-spatial life. As Dave nears Saturn’s monolith,
the monolith unfolds spacetime absorbs Dave’s ship into its abyss. Dave
senses he’s moving at incredible speed and believes the monolith to be
some sort of “star gate” that facilitates faster-than-light travel. His
pod lands in what appears to be an ordinary hotel room, prepared for
someone of his species to eventually discover. He sleeps, relives his
past, and is transformed into an extra-spatial omnipotent being
(“Star-Child”) with the power to influence matter and help guide mankind
through a new stage of evolution.</p>
<h2 id="atlas-shrugged">Atlas Shrugged</h2>
<p>Atlas Shrugged is a 1957 novel by Ayn Rand. It espouses her
philosophy of Objectivism.</p>
<p>The primary protagonist is Dagny Taggart, a VP at the Taggart
Transcontinental railroad business run by her brother James. Dagny is
self-sufficient, efficient, and scourns government interference in the
business. Her brother James is a dirty statist and egalitarian who
welcomes government interference in the business.</p>
<p>A secondary protagonist is James Rearden, a pessimistic entrepreneur
who invents Rearden Metal, cheaper yet stronger than traditional steel.
Dagny is excited by the prospects of the new alloy whereas her brother
James, despite Rearden Metal’s clear superiority, is more concerned on
its potential impact on the legacy steel industry.</p>
<p>Dagny learns that her old friend and lover, copper magnate Francisco
d’Anconia, is intentionally sabotaging his business. She also discovers
a revolutionary new motor design in an abandoned factory, with no known
inventor or applied use; she can’t comprehend either of these
discoveries – why Francisco is destroying his business or why an
inventor would abandon the new motor design.</p>
<p>The government steps up its economic interference by nationalizing
patents and forbidding employees from quitting. Dagny has finally had
enough and illegally leaves her job in defiance of the order, but ends
up returning to Taggart Transcontinental after a disaster occurs in one
of their tunnels. Dagny begins to hear more and more people mutter under
their breathes, “Who is John Galt?” – an expression of resignation
(i.e. “what’s the use?”) and, we eventually learn, a literal question
about a man.</p>
<p>Dagny crashes a private plan while chasing an employee whom she hoped
to convince not to leave the company. Among the wreckage, she finally
learns why d’Anconia was sabotaging his business; why the new motor
designer did nothing with his invention; to where some of the world’s
leading tycoons had disappeared – a man named John Galt had convinced
them all to leave the world behind and to live quietly in his hidden
Gulch instead, as a protest against the government’s increasing
intervention and expropriation of their work and the economy.</p>
<p>When Dagny peeks her head back out into the world, the government is
even more incompetent and totalitarian than before. John Galt delivers a
three-hour speech over the radio urging them to take pride in their own
work; to forge forward and invent and create; to be in charge of their
own destinies; to refuse to allow the government to siphon, steal, and
tax their creative output and livelihoods to death. Galt is arrested but
quickly rescued by his minions, and New York City plunges into chaos as
the electricity goes out. Such is the planned, centralized economy of
government intervention, and among its ruins, John Galt and his
followers are prepared to rebuild anew.</p>
<h2 id="the-brothers-karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</h2>
<p>The Brothers Karamazov is an 1880 philosophical novel by Fyodor
Dostoevsky. It tells the story of four brothers and the murder of their
father.</p>
<p>Fyodor Pavlovich Karamazov is a selfish codger with four sons by
three mothers.</p>
<p>The eldest son, Dmitri (Mitya), is a “bad Catholic” – or what some
simply call “Catholic.” Specific theologies aside, Dmitri is a sinner
seeking salvation. He does bad, but seeks good. He succumbs to his
basest, primal impulses, yet occasionally manages to deny them in
pursuit of spiritual redemption. He is a man, flaws and all. Dmitri’s
central conflicts with his father involve a love triangle with a younger
woman and an inheritance from his mother which he hasn’t access to.</p>
<p>The middle son, Ivan (Vanya), is the intellectual. He is analytical,
calculated, and deeply concerned with human suffering. He could be a
brilliant theologian if only he could reconcile the existence of human
suffering with a belief in God, but alas, he cannot. Ivan would rather
be wrong but win a debate than be right and lose a debate. He’s a
showman who loves exposing contradictions but, because he cannot
logically solve life’s great questions, doesn’t live a particularly
joyful life. His words inadvertently lead to Fyodor’s murder and
Dmitri’s unjust condemnation.</p>
<p>The youngest son, Alexei (Alyosha), is the faithful one. He studies
beneath Father Zosima, who encourages him to gain experience in the real
world before cloistering himself in a monastery. He is loving,
forgiving, and naive. Alexei loves his brothers, as he loves all, and
occasionally helps them moderate their sinful pursuits. He tutors young
children in moral character and faith, and ultimately redeems the
Karamazov name so tainted by his father.</p>
<p>The rejected son, Smerdyakov (Pavel), is an epileptic bastard. He
serves as Fyodor’s house servant. He is the son of “Reeking Lizaveta”, a
mute who died in childbirth after (allegedly) getting knocked up by
Fyodor. Smerdyakov tortured animals growing up. He love-hates his father
and loves his brother Ivan. His actions advertently lead to Fyodor’s
murder and inadvertently to Ivan’s mental breakdown.</p>
<p><em>Book I.</em> The novel starts with an introduction to the
family.</p>
<p><em>Books II &amp; III.</em> They visit Father Zosima to help mediate
the dispute over the inheritance from Dmitri’s mother, but to no avail.
There is a deeper conflict beneath it all – Fyodor and Dmitri are in
love with the same woman.</p>
<p><em>Book IV.</em> Alyosha tries to help a schoolboy who’s being
bullied, but ends up apologizing to the boy’s father for Dmitri’s past
behavior.</p>
<p><em>Book V.</em> Ivan jests with Alyosha over his faith, and launches
into a long poem titled The Grand Inquisitor. In the poem, Jesus returns
during the Spanish inquisition, is imprisoned, and is chastised for his
decision to grant free will to man, as that responsibility was too great
a burden and led to human suffering. In response, Jesus kisses his
prison guard and is released. Upon hearing the poem, Alyosha kisses his
brother Ivan.</p>
<p><em>Book VI.</em> Father Zosima recounts his life story, and explains
his belief that everyone shares responsibility for their neighbors’
sins.</p>
<p><em>Book VII.</em> Father Zosima dies and his body decomposes,
disappointing many who believe that the bodies of holy men don’t
decompose in death. Alyosha mourns his mentor and ventures back into the
world, per Father Zosima’s earlier instructions.</p>
<p><em>Book VIII.</em> Dmitri stalks outside of his father Fyodor’s
house, suspecting that the woman whom they both love went to visit his
father. He carries a brass pestle. Time flashes forward and Dmitri flees
the property, knocking a servant out along the way. Dmitri gets drunk
while covered in blood and carrying a wad of money, and is subsequently
arrested for the murder of Fyodor.</p>
<p><em>Book IX.</em> Dmitri is interrogated. He admits to striking the
servant, but denies murdering his father and refuses to explain how he
came into money. This is complicated by the fact that money went missing
from Fyodor’s house upon the murder. The only other possible suspect is
Smerdyakov, but he was in an epileptic fit when the murder occurred. For
lack of better explanation and Dmitri’s refusal to disclose how he
acquired the money, he is formally charged and imprisoned.</p>
<p><em>Book X.</em> A friend of the schoolboy met earlier in Book IV is
growing up to be a smart-ass atheist, like Ivan. Alyosha challenges the
boy’s nihilism.</p>
<p><em>Book XI.</em> Ivan meets three times with Smerdyakov and
eventually learns the Smerdyakov is the murderer. Smerdyakov admits to
faking an epileptic fit and murdering their father. He offers Ivan the
stolen money and explains that he never would’ve murdered the old man
were it not for Ivan, for it was through Ivan whom Smerdyakov learned
that all is permissible and that religious morality is herd mentality.
Ivan is horrified by the impact of his words and suffers a mental
breakdown. The devil visits him in hallucinations and mocks his beliefs.
Smerdyakov commits suicide without confessing to anyone else, and
intentionally omits his responsibility for the murder from his suicide
note.</p>
<p><em>Book XII.</em> A mockery of trial finds Dmitri guilty. Ivan
remains tormented by guilt, and has yet to recover from his mental
breakdown.</p>
<p><em>Epilogue.</em> Dmitri accepts his fate. There’s talk of an escape
plan and he reconciles with one of his former lovers who falsely accused
him during the trial. But no escape is to be witnessed. Instead, Alyosha
leads a funeral service for a young schoolboy recently departed. He
implores the children to love deep and wide, to forgive all, and to
cherish every moment and memory they have. The boys are enraptured by
his speech, and end the novel cheering “Hurrah for Karamazov.” In
Alyosha, the Karamazov family name has been redeemed.</p>
<h2 id="bushido-the-soul-of-japan">Bushido: The Soul of Japan</h2>
<p>Bushido: The Soul of Japan is a 1900 book by Inazo Nitobé. It is an
explanation and musing for western audiences of the character, ethics,
and history of the Japanese samurai.</p>
<p>According to author Inazo Nitobé, <em>Bu-shi-do</em> translates to
<em>Military-Knight-Ways</em> — the character, teachings, ethics, and
chivalry of Japanese sword-warriors. The system is simple: total
allegiance to master, death for dishonor, sword as last resort, and
honor over all. To die for an unworthy cause is cowardice; to slay an
unworthy foe is murder.</p>
<p>For better or worse, samurai are depicted as the archetypal
warrior-poet. He is stoic, steadfast, and dangerous, yet has
self-control and lives in harmony with the dis/order of society. Nitobé
defends old Japan from the ethical, political, and social criticism
levied by the prevailing cultural hegemony (barbarism, imperialism,
classism, sexism). The Japanese order is bound by a voluntary,
self-imposed ethic of duty, honor, and restraint unknown to the
West.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Only a pomegranate is he” — so runs a popular saying — “who, when he
gapes his mouth, displays the contents of his heart.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Seppuku</em> or <em>kappuku</em> (<em>hara-kiri</em>) was not
mere suicide — it was ceremonial. The use of disembowelment was based on
the ancient belief of the gut as the seat of the soul. Bearing it openly
was an offering to view their innermost character for judgement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No one circle in the Inferno will boast of greater density of
Japanese population than the seventh, to which Dante consigns all
victims of self-destruction!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bushido “set a moral standard for [the populace] and guided them by
their example.” Although it lives no longer as a system, it is immortal
as a virtue. For “wherever man struggles to raise himself above himself,
wherever his spirit masters his flesh by his own exertions, there we see
the immortal discipline of Zeno at work.”</p>
<h2 id="candide">Candide</h2>
<p>Candide is a 1759 novella by François-Marie Arouet aka Voltaire.</p>
<p>The story is not only too short for a good synopsis, but also not
good enough for one. Technically it’s satire, but of the boring variety
with little humor or wit. Basically, it ridicules Leibniz’s theodicy of
the ““est of all possible worlds” – his attempt to solve the “problem of
evil” – by showing an optimist continually being shat upon.</p>
<p>Unlike Joyce’s <em>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</em>
which, in its critique of Christianity, at least attempts to faithfully
represent the Catholic tradition and experience, Candide attacks a straw
man.</p>
<p>That it’s considered Voltaire’s magnum opus doesn’t bode well for the
value of his other works (admittedly unread by this author). Its
crowning achievement seems only to be that he shat upon some Christian
theology before radical secularism trickled into Europe after the French
Revolution.</p>
<h2 id="the-carlyle-anthology">The Carlyle Anthology</h2>
<p>The Carlyle Anthology is an 1876 collection of Thomas Carlyle
excerpts compiled by Edward Barrett.</p>
<p>It’s a very accessible introduction to Carlyle’s thought, as it
covers his biographical profiles, his great man theory of history, his
ideas on the power and virtue of the written word, and some of his
political arguments against populism and universal suffrage.</p>
<p>Carlyle’s writing style can be a difficult for modern readers due to
his prose and punctuation style, so these shorter excerpts may be easier
to digest than his full works. The anthology is broken into six
sections: (1) Life, and the Conduct of Life; (2) Portraits and
Characters; (3) Literature, and the Literary Life; (4) Religion; (5)
Politics; and (6) Historical and Miscellaneous.</p>
<h2 id="crime-and-punishment">Crime and Punishment</h2>
<p>Crime and Punishment is an 1866 novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.</p>
<p>Raskolnikov, a poor man in St. Petersburg, schemes to rob an old
pawnshop owner for her money. After scouting out her apartment, he
returns with an axe, pretending that he wants to pawn an item.
Raskolnikov strikes her down, and then her half-sister when she walks
into the room. In panic, he flees with a small handfull of items worth
far less than the lives he took.</p>
<p>Despite not being an immediate suspect, Raskolnikov falls ill from
the psychological burden of his murders. He becomes prone to fainting,
fevers, and delirium. Thoughts of confession preoccupy him. Those near
and attending to him are Luzhin, his sister Dunya’s wealthy fiance;
Razumikhin, an old friend; and Zamyotov, a policeman. After revisiting
the apartment, morbidly obsessed with the murders, he returns home and
faints upon finding his mother and sister awaiting him.</p>
<p>Raskolnikov fiercely opposes Dunya’s marriage to Luzhin, believing
him to be an opportunist and Dunya motivated only by the security his
money can provide the family. His friend Razumikhin takes him to see
Petrovich, a detective, and Raskolnikov suspects that Petrovich already
knows he’s guilty of the murders. Petrovich questions him about an old
article he wrote, On Crime, which argued that certain people are both
legally and morally justified to commit forbidden acts (such as theft
and murder) in pursuit of their ideas.</p>
<p>A former suitor of Dunya, Svidrigailov, is in Raskolnikov’s room when
he wakes the next morning. Svidrigailov insists that Dunya call off her
engagement to Luzhin, and bequeaths 3,000 rubles to Dunya per his late
wife’s will. Dunya sends Luzhin away, and the family is relieved to
finally have some money on hand.</p>
<p>Raskolnikov heads back into an interview with Petrovich, who
insinuates that he knows Raskolnikov is guilty of murdering the
pawnbroker Alyona and her half-sister Lizaveta. To both their surprise,
a young painter bursts into the station and confesses to the
murders.</p>
<p>After a funeral banquet for a man that Raskolnikov saw killed earlier
in the street by a carriage, he heads home with the deceased’s daughter,
Sonya, upon whom he’s taken pity. Raskolnikov confesses to his crime and
desperately tries to explain his motives and thus justify his actions.
Sonya, however, herself in pain but pious, urges him to confess to save
his conscious and soul. They rush outside after hearing that her
step-mother is throwing a fit in the street after being evicted from her
apartment. There he sees Svidrigailov, who directly quotes Raskolnikov’s
earlier admission to Sonya, tacitly revealing that he overheard the
entire confession.</p>
<p>Soon thereafter, Petrovich surprises Raskolnikov for a quick chat,
and tells him straight-out that he knows Raskolnikov is the murderer,
that Raskolnikov will be arrested soon, and that it would be better for
all if he would simply confess. Svidrigailov tells Dunya about her
brother’s confession to Sonya, and with no chance of her requitted love,
commits suicide the next morning in public.</p>
<p>Raskolnikov says goodbye to his mother and sister, receives a
crucifix from Sonya, and heads to the police station. There he learns of
Svidrigailov’s suicide and makes a full confession. He is sentenced to
eight years of labor in Siberia, during which his mother passes. Sonya
follows him to Siberia, and despite feeling unworthy of her love, he
accepts his sins and seeks redemption in Sonya’s loving presence.</p>
<h2 id="dont-vote-it-just-encourages-the-bastards">Don’t Vote – It Just
Encourages the Bastards</h2>
<p>Don’t Vote — It Just Encourages the Bastards is a 2010 book by P. J.
O’Rourke. It describes the American politico-economic system and his
personal journey from the left-wing to libertarianism. Synopsis</p>
<p>For better or worse, this is one of P. J. O’Rourke’s more serious
books. He spends a fair amount of time on political theory, e.g. the
U.S. model as one of free people consenting to being governed as opposed
to governed people permitted to be “free,” and the “pursuit of
happiness” as an unparalleled unalienable right among the founding
documents and constitutions of developed nations.</p>
<p>He also delights in delineating between negative and positive rights,
or “get-outa-heres” and “gimmes.” Negative rights are freedoms from or
shall nots, whereas positive rights are for or rights to something
(e.g. “shall not be infringed” vs. “shall enjoy the right to”).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Positive rights themselves, in turn, are absurdly expandable… Even
negative rights aren’t free… But positive rights require no end of
money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of O’Rourke’s core theses is that the free market is not an
economic ideology, per se, but rather the quickest, most accurate, and
most effective system for measuring “what people are willing to pay for
a given thing at a given moment.” This is all that the free market does
— provides us with information.</p>
<p>To obtain this crowd-sourced measurement of value, the free market
requires a social system which permit individuals to choose for
themselves their means of employment, what they wish to have and
accomplish, and to freely exchange their products of labor with one
another. Without these, the measurement is distorted.</p>
<p>In practice, our markets aren’t free: certain businesses are not
allowed to fail (bailouts); certain industries are price controlled
(rent ceilings); certain goods are barred and restricted (tariffs). Then
there’s excessive taxation, cronyism, and all the other delights of
modern politic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is the duty of every politically informed and engaged person to do
everything he or she can to prevent politics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part history, part theory, and part autobiography, Don’t Vote offers
a 10,000-foot view on O’Rourke’s understanding of political theory, and
a 10-foot view on how it impacted him personally.</p>
<h2 id="dracula">Dracula</h2>
<p>Dracula is an 1897 horror novel by Bram Stoker. It introduced the
Count Dracula character and is told through diary entries, letters, and
newspaper clippings.</p>
<p>The opening chapters detail a lawyer who visits Transylvania and
slowly discovers that he’s essentially become a prisoner to Count
Dracula, who sleeps in dirt and slithers down walls. Good stuff.</p>
<p>After that it gets a little boring, with passengers mysteriously
disappearing on a ship headed to England. Surprise, it’s Dracula.</p>
<p>Then it gets really boring, as we learn about marriage proposals
between two slags. The only saving grace is an apparent psychotic in a
local ward who first collects then eats insects, spiders, birds, and
rats.</p>
<p>One of the slags gets sick and dies, despite lots of garlic. Turns
out her death was due to Dracula, and some gent named Val Helsing
teaches them how to fight the vampire, which involves inoculating the
boxes of special dirt that Dracula has to sleep in at night.</p>
<p>The remaining slag is forced to drink Dracula’s blood so he can
control her, but the heroes turn that against Dracula and use her
hysteria to track him down. Apparently he took a box of his special dirt
back to Transylvania.</p>
<p>Once in Transylvania, the heroes evade some gypsies protecting the
Count and somehow manage to kill him with a knife to the heart. The slag
recovers and they agree they won’t be able to convince others of their
story.</p>
<h2 id="heretics">Heretics</h2>
<p>Heretics is a 1905 collection of essays by G. K. Chesterton. It
contains arguments against popular ideas by fashionable and/or
contemporary authors of his day.</p>
<p>Chesterton begins with a defense of terminology, with orthodox
traditionally being an adjective for correct. He suggests that even the
most extreme partisans like violent anarchists must consider themselves
orthodox to be morally justified in their actions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Orthodox: Right, correct, true; in accordance with what is accepted
or authoritatively established as the true view or right practice. —
Oxford English Dictionary, accessed May 8, 2020.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He laments that in modern society everything seems to matter except
that which is most practical and important — a man’s view of the
universe: “A man’s opinions on tramcars matters; his opinion on
Boticelli matters; his opinion on all things does not matter… [for] the
modern idea is that cosmic truth is so unimportant that it cannot matter
what any one says.”</p>
<p>He argues that we seem to talk of everything except the essential
questions, such as “What is good?” and “What is the good of being a
man?” The need for ever more “progress” is on the tip of everyone’s
tongue, and yet, what is this “progress” we speak of — if we know not,
truly, what we’re progressing from, leaving behind, or what we really
need to become our best selves?</p>
<p>Chesterton attempts to peel back our conventional use of language to
reveal the hidden beauty and mystery of the world, the sacred hiding in
the profane. Even something as simple as a control station to coordinate
train movements holds a depth of meaning. In the material, it is an
electronic system for toggling colored lights; but in the poetical, “it
is a place where men, in an agony of vigilance, light blood-red and
sea-green fires to keep other men from death.”</p>
<p>Without intending to, for the word “conservative” appears no where
near the following quote, Chesterton lays out one of the most sincere
and simple explanations of the conservative impulse: “The moment we care
for anything deeply, the world — that is, all the other miscellaneous
interests — becomes our enemy.”</p>
<p>He goes on to argue that the cosmopolitan, the traveler, the global
citizen lives in a smaller world, in some sense, than the local
townsman. The argument isn’t particularly convincing, with the traveler
noticing all the differences between people &amp; places and the
townsman focusing on similarities, but he builds on the idea later by
suggesting that the traveler lives in a smaller ideological world
because they’re able to find and congregate with like-minded people and
their movement permits them to live unattached to community, whereas the
townsman has no choice but to accept and live alongside his neighbors no
matter their creed.</p>
<p>In his chapter on Shaw, Chesterton emphasizes that to compare man to
der übermensch or a transhuman future or any other progressive ideal is
to lose sight of the very thing in front of you — man in all his natural
splendor, and beauty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not seeing things as they are to start with a vision of Argus
with his hundred eyes, and then jeer at every man with two eyes as if he
had only one. And it is not seeing things as they are to imagine a
demi-god of infinite mental clarity, who may or may not appear in the
latter days of the earth, and then to see all men as idiots… When we
really see men as they are, we do not criticise, but worship; and very
rightly. For a monster with mysterious eyes and miraculous thumbs, with
strange dreams in his skull, and a queer tenderness for this place or
that baby, is truly a wonderful and unnerving matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chesterton defends ritual as older than human thought; it arises from
in feeling the nature of things that there are certain proper things to
say and do.</p>
<p>In his chapter on Moore, Chesterton digs into the “formal doctrine of
the sin of pride”: it is solitary, not social; it desires the applause
of itself, not an audience; it inserts itself where it doesn’t belong.
While Alfred Korzybski &amp; Robert Anton Wilson would applaud the
following quote, Chesterton is speaking not of recognizing the
distinction between perception &amp; reality, but rather of the ego’s
insistence to draw focus upon itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And he intrudes the capital “I” even where it need not be intruded —
even where it weakens the force of a plain statement. Where another man
would say, “It is a fine day,” Mr. Moore says, “Seen through my
temperament, the day appeared fine.” Where another man would say,“Milton
has obviously a fine style,” Mr. Moore would say, “As a stylist Milton
had always impressed me.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s other interesting stuff too. The end.</p>
<h2 id="journey-to-the-center-of-the-earth">Journey to the Center of the
Earth</h2>
<p>Journey to the Center of the Earth is an 1864 novel by Jules Verne.
It follows three explorers on their journey into an inactive volcano in
Iceland, where they discover creatures of the prehistoric world still
live.</p>
<p>An orphaned young lad joins his eccentric mineralogist uncle to
retrace the steps of an earlier explorer who allegedly found a route
into the center of the earth. They prep materials, fly to Iceland, get a
guide and climb down into a volcano. They trek deeper and deeper
underground.</p>
<p>For three chapters they’re thirsty for water, and then they find some
water. Eventually they come upon a subterranean ocean. Crossing it, they
see ancient dinosaurs fighting below them, then they’re shipwrecked –
but still with enough supplies to go on.</p>
<p>They explore the shore, see some tall prehistoric man trotting about,
some skeletons, the usual. After finding their route caved in, they use
some dynamite and accidentally unleash the water around them. The floods
shoot them up and up and eventually out of Etna (a different
volcano).</p>

<h2 id="the-most-dangerous-book">The Most Dangerous Book</h2>
<p>The Most Dangerous Book is a non-fiction book by Kevin Birmingham
about the publication of James Joyce’s Ulysses. Unlike other major works
on Joyce or his works, Birmingham focuses on the obscenity trials
surrounding the publication of Ulysses in the United States of America
(“the states”).</p>
<p>There were at least three cases concerning Ulysses in the states. The
first over the Comstock Act of 1873, the second over the Tariff Act of
1930, and the third an appeal over the second.</p>
<h3 id="the-little-review">1921: The Little Review</h3>
<p>In 1921, The Little Review was found guilty of violating the Comstock
obscenity laws for serializing Ulysses. In particular, it was due to
their publication of the Nausicaa episode – wherein it is alluded that
Bloom masturbates to a woman at the beach. An attorney in New York,
whose daughter received the issue unsolicited in the mail, brought the
issue to the Society for the Suppression of Vice, who later filed a
formal complaint.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the two publishers (Margaret Caroline Anderson and Jane
Heap) were found guilty of violation of the Comstock Act of 1873. They
were levied a $100 fine and ceased publication of Ulysses. During the
trial, one of the judges allegedly said that “[The episode] sound[ed] to
[him] like the ravings of a disordered mind,” and that he couldn’t “see
why anyone would want to publish it.”</p>
<p>The verdict ended the serialization of Ulysses in the states, and
official publications wouldn’t be made available until 1933. The
effective banning of the novel, unsurprisingly, generated new interest
in the work. Unofficial bootleg publications circulated, most notably by
a publisher named Samuel Roth. Though Roth’s publication was supposedly
a protest against censorship, Joyce never received any compensation, the
editions introduced typographical errors, and other authors issued a
public letter against Roth for theft and corruption of the text.</p>
<h3 id="united-states-v.-one-book-called-ulysses">1933: United States v.
One Book Called “Ulysses”</h3>
<p>Random House owned the rights to publish Ulysses in the states but
didn’t believe they could publish it due the previous ruling against The
Little Review. So, they schemed. In 1932, in order to trigger a test
case (designed to set precedent), Random House imported Ulysses from
France and intentionally tipped off U.S. Customs about the shipment.
When Customs failed to confiscate the shipment upon its arrival, an
attorney for Random House delivered the package to Customs and demanded
they confiscate it. They did.</p>
<p>The Southern District of New York (SDNY) heard the case, with Random
House seeking to dismiss the states’s action to seize and destroy the
works for obscenity under the Tariff Act of 1930. The case was presided
over by Judge John M. Woolsey. Some points of note are that Woolsey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determined that a trial by jury was unfeasable, due to the length
and difficulty of Ulysses.</li>
<li>Read Ulysses in its entirety before adjudicating, and admitted that
the study of Ulysses is “a heavy task.”</li>
<li>Did not consider the work “obscene” as defined by the courts
(“tending to stir the sex impulses”).</li>
<li>Understood the work to be “a serious experiment in a new, if not
wholly novel, literary genre.”</li>
<li>Considered the work “brilliant and dull, intelligible and obscure,
by turns,” and that he did not find “anything that [he] considered to be
dirt for dirt’s sake.”</li>
</ul>
<p>Judge Woolsey dismissed the case and declared that “Ulysses may,
therefore, be admitted into the United States.”</p>
<h3 id="united-states-v.-one-book-entitled-ulysses-by-james-joyce">1934:
United States v. One Book Entitled Ulysses by James Joyce</h3>
<p>The verdict was appealed to the Second Circuit and heard by three
judges: Martin Manton, the awesomely named Learned Hand, and Hand’s
slightly less awesomely named cousin Augustus Noble Hand. The Hands
upheld the prior ruling, with Manton dissenting.</p>
<p>Manton’s dissent was due to Joyce’s alleged transgressions against
noble moral standards. He asserted that certain pages were “too indecent
to add as a footnote to [his] opinion,” that it was “written for alleged
amusement of the reader only,” and that it was “art for art’s sake”
rather than “art for the people’s service.”</p>
<p>Noble Hand wrote the majority opinion. Like Woolsey, he praised
Ulysses and Joyces style, stating that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joyce “may be regarded as a pioneer among those writers who have
adopted the ‘stream of consciousness’ method of presenting fiction.</li>
<li>Ulysses is rated as a book of considerable power by persons whose
opinions are entitled to weight.</li>
<li>Certain passages “are of beauty and undoubted distinction, while
others are of a vulgarity that is extreme.”</li>
<li>“Joyce… has dealt with ‘things unattempted yet in prose or rime.’”
[sic]</li>
<li>“Page after page of the book is, or seems to be,
incomprehensible.”</li>
<li>“In numerous places there are found originality, beauty, and
distinction… while in not a few spots it is coarse, blasphemous, and
obscene.”</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hands handed the verdict thus. Random House was free to publish
James Joyce’s Ulysses, and precedent is now such that obscenity
adjudications should consider, among other things, the entire work
rather than excerpts.</p>
<h2 id="the-mysterious-flame-of-queen-loana">The Mysterious Flame of
Queen Loana</h2>
<p>The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is a 2004 novel by Umberto Eco.
It’s about a man with memory loss trying to piece his life history
together through family artifacts.</p>
<p>Giambattista “Yambo” Bodoni awakens in a hospital with no memory of
self. Lyrics, book passages and quotations, cultural expressions are all
that remain readily available to him. He learns he is married, has
grandchildren, and is an antiquarian book dealer. At his wife’s
encouragement, he travels alone to his family’s old country estate to
see if the house, and the abandoned possessions within, can help conjure
up any real sense of his identity.</p>
<p>For over a week he explores old books in the attic, much of which
seems like an excuse for the author to go on Joycean, list-making
tangents detailing many forgotten 20th-century cultural artifacts –
artwork featured on old metal tins, children’s books which had Italian
identities interjected into the characters when the stories were
imported into Fascist Italy, etc. Some interesting cultural history, but
of no real consequence to the plot.</p>
<p>Despite spending over a week at the estate, there’s somehow always
another box he hasn’t looked through yet. That lets the author reminisce
on growing up under Il Duce, which in turn lets Yambo question how he
felt about it all. The reader is subjected to pages of cringe teen
poetry and learns that Yambo’s grandfather poured a vial of feces down a
fascist’s throat and bragged to him about it the next morning.
Eventually, we learn that as a teenager Yambo fell in love with a girl,
was basically a creep over the way he obsessed on her, and that she died
aged 18 shortly after moving from town. He had only learned of her death
and real name (Savilla) shortly before the amnesia and can’t recall her
face</p>
<p>Again, somehow, there’s still another box he hasn’t gone through. The
last box, and – surprise! – it contains an original First Folio of
Shakespeare’s works, which can gross over $6,000,000 at auction. Then
everything goes black and Yambo is pure mind. His best guess is that he
lies in a coma, having suffered another stroke at the shock of
discovering the book, but the good news is that his memory starts
flooding back to him.</p>
<p>Yambo’s mind is adrift in no-place and no-time. Ideas and memories
surface. Some even seem real – that is, his. A cascade of characters
from film and comic books march across his mind. He is getting closer to
the one thing he wants – to see Savilla’s face. He knows she was an
instrumental figure in him becoming who he was – whomever that is – as
she was imprinted forever into his nervous system as a young,
impressionable teenage boy. Yes, she is the answer. She is the key that
will unlock the mystery of his identity. The cascade of characters
continues their ceremonial march across his consciousness until,
finally, she is up next. As she’s about to appear, all goes black.</p>
<h2 id="parliament-of-whores">Parliament of Whores</h2>
<p>Parliament of Whores is a 1991 book by P. J. O’Rourke that satirizes
the U.S. government.</p>
<p>P.J. breaks down the daily on the U.S. government. There’s the three
branches, where all are incompetent. There’s the extended bureaucracy,
where all are incompetent. And there’s government spending, where all is
wasted.</p>
<p>With the structure &amp; financing of the federal government
established, P.J. peeks into policy. What, exactly, does government buy
with its spending? Turns out, not much. They waste money on drug policy,
poverty initiatives, farm subsidies, and foreign aid.</p>
<p>Then he mocks public protests, the economics of radical ecologists,
and the U.S. government’s most entitled entitlement program, Social
Security.</p>
<p>It’s classic P.J. – incisive, irreverent, and now irrelevant. Most of
the stories and statistics have aged with the tide of time, but still
worth a chuckle. And for better or worse, P.J.’s description of
incompetent and wasteful government spending is a quaint, bygone memory
of better days – better days where incompetent and wasteful government
spending was less incompetent and wasteful than it is today.</p>
<h2 id="the-prague-cemetary">The Prague Cemetary</h2>
<p>The Prague Cemetary is a 2010 novel by Umberto Eco.</p>
<p>Simone Simoni, lawyer-plagiarist, goes on exciting and antisemitic
escapades across 19th-century Europe.</p>
<p>Simoni learned from his grandfather at an early age that the French
Revolution, Knights Templar, and Weishaupt’s Illuminati were all
marionettes dancing from sweaty, swarthy Jewish fingers. Furthermore,
everything wrong or suspect in the world is the direct or indirect
result of the inescapable Jewish instinct to undermine their host
nations. Seek, and ye shall find.</p>
<p>This ugly, unhappy man is recruited as an asset by the Kingdom of
Sardinia (RIP) to gin up forgeries on behalf of, or to further the
interests of, their “intelligence” agencies. He’s basically a grand
wizard at everything – forgery, double-agency, and even personality
disorder.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, Abbe Dalla Piccola, one of the alter-egos he
used to infiltrate sources, becomes a split personality. The novel is
mostly a serious of written correspondences between Simoni and his other
half, Piccola, as they try to piece together the history of their lives
and how they’re interconnected.</p>
<p>There is, however, no great resolve to the many conflicts presented
herein. Simoni realizes he is Piccola, and vice versa, and they live
happily together as one entity again. But the reader receives no grand
conclusion to their story. Simoni is just on a path, though not
explicitly stated, to piece together his magnum opus – an amalgamation
of his greatest antisemitic forgeries into the infamous Protocols of the
Elders of Zion.</p>
<p>And that’s sort of it. A story of 19th-century cultural and political
undercurrents, told through a mentally unstable forger, as the author’s
explanations for how the Protocols of the Elders of Zion might have been
written. Altogether a crude and disconnected, sometimes fun,
hypothetical in novel form.</p>
<h2 id="ulysses">Ulysses</h2>
<p>Ulysses is a 1922 novel by Irish author James Joyce. The 730 page
story takes place on June 16, 1904, in Dublin, Ireland. The chapters are
unnamed, but have since been identified by scholars as mapping to
Homer’s Odyssey, such that the characters and events in the novel
correspond to different parts of Odysseus’s journey from Troy back to
Ithaca.</p>
<p>The three main characters are Leopold Bloom, his wife Molly, and his
friend Stephen Dedalus. The story is of their ordinary day in Dublin –
conversations, eaves-droppings, disagreements, estrangements, drunken
escapades – from the morning’s first shave to crawling back into
bed.</p>
<p>The chapters jump between different characters across Dublin, with
Joyce utilizing a stream-of-consciousness style to simulate their
thought processes and inner monologue. The characters often intersect
and interact with each other throughout the day.</p>
<p>It is notorious for its reputation as being one of the most difficult
novels to read, with Joyce remarking that “it will keep the professors
busy for centuries arguing over what I meant.” It is also notable for
being subjected to an obscenity trial in the U.S. for heretical and
sexual references.</p>
<p>The novel is celebrated annually as Bloomsday in major cities
worldwide every June 16th, but especially in Dublin, where radio
performances, street readings, and tours of the novel’s locations take
place.</p>
<p><em>01. Telemachus.</em> Buck Mulligan eats breakfast with Stephen
Dedalus at the Sandycove Martello tower. They walk to the shore and have
a disagreement.</p>
<p><em>02. Nestor.</em> Stephen teaches a history class and speaks with
the school’s headmaster. They discuss Irish history, Jews in the
economy, and Stephen is given a letter to deliver to the local newspaper
office.</p>
<p><em>03. Proteus.</em> Stephen daydreams at the Sandymount Strand and
thinks of his mother’s death.</p>
<p><em>04. Calypso.</em> Leopold Bloom eats a hearty breakfast and buys
pork kidney from the butcher. He delivers the mail to his wife Molly and
sees that she received a letter from Blazes Boylan, with whom Leopold
knows she’s having an affair.</p>
<p><em>05. Lotus Eaters.</em> Stephen picks up his own love letter from
the post office, but unlike Molly &amp; Blazes, his forbidden romance
isn’t yet physical. He buys some soap from a local store.</p>
<p><em>06. Hades.</em> Leopold attends a funeral where Stephen’s father
is also in attendance. He reflects on the early death of his son and the
suicide of his father.</p>
<p><em>07. Aeolus.</em> Leopold fails to place an advertisement in the
local newspaper. Stephen shows up with the headmasters letter and takes
the editor to a pub.</p>
<p><em>08. Lestrygonians.</em> Leopold eats lunch at Davy Byrne’s pub,
thinking about how his relationship with Molly has changed over the
years. Afterwards he heads to a local museum, but shirks into another
building after seeing his wife’s lover Blazes nearby.</p>
<p><em>09. Scylla and Charybdis.</em> Stephen is in the National Library
espousing wild theories on Shakespeare. Leopold enters the library
looking for an old copy of the advertisement he failed to place in
Episode 7.</p>
<p><em>10. Wandering Rocks.</em> Various characters walk about the
town.</p>
<p><em>11. Sirens.</em> Leopold eats dinner with Stephen’s uncle while
Blazes heads out to have an affair with Leopold’s his wife Molly.</p>
<p><em>12. Cyclops.</em> Two unnamed characters drink in a pub. One of
them berates Leopold for being Jewish.</p>
<p><em>13. Nausicaa.</em> Leopold heads to the Sandymount Strand, where
he secretly masturbates to three women on the beach while fireworks
shoot off.</p>
<p><em>14. Oxen of the Sun.</em> Leopold visits a hospital to support
Mina Purefoy, who is in labor. He meets Stephen, Mina bears a son, and
the men head to a pub to continue drinking.</p>
<p><em>15. Circe.</em> Drunk, Leopold and Stephen head to a brothel.
Stephen has an outburst and breaks a chandelier, then is punched by an
English soldier in the street.</p>
<p><em>16. Eumaeus.</em> Leopold tries to sober Stephen up. They talk
with a drunken sailor.</p>
<p><em>17. Ithaca.</em> Leopold takes Stephen to his (Leopold’s) home
and offers him a bed for the night, which Stephen refuses. After a quick
piss outside, Stephen heads off into the night. Leopold crawls into bed
and Molly wakes to ask him about his day.</p>
<p><em>18. Penelope.</em> Molly drifts back to sleep, thinking about her
husband Leopold, her lover Blazes, and her childhood. She falls asleep
remembering Leopold’s proposal to her, to which she responded yes, yes,
yes.</p>
<h2 id="unlimited-memory">Unlimited Memory</h2>
<p>Unlimited Memory is a 2014 book by Kevin Horsley. It describes mental
tricks to improve memory and retention.</p>
<p>Kevin Horsley is a “Grandmaster of Memory” who ranks in the top 1,000
worldwide across multiple memory “disciplines.” He holds the second
fastest time in the “Everest” of memory tests, which measures how fast
participants can recite random selections of 5-digit chunks within the
first 10,000 digits of pi.</p>
<p>The first tip is not to multitask. Multitasking is less efficient
since it takes time for the brain to switch between tasks. Practice
“consecutive tasking” instead of “simultaneous tasking.”</p>
<p>The second tip is to be interested in the material, even if you need
to feign curiosity. Having a specific purpose for learning some
material, and being interested in learning it, improves concentration
and increases the amount of information retained (read: duh).</p>
<p>The main tip or trick, though, is to create strong, unique word
associations and visual stories for what you wish to memorize.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Canberra, Australia: Imagine a kangaroo (which represents Australia)
eating a can of berries.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Athens, Greece: Imagine eight hens swimming in grease… Imagine a
silly picture… [Bring] information to life with your endless
imagination.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="carbody-method">Car/Body Method</h3>
<p>The car method or body method can be used to memorize unordered
lists. It involves placing your unique, creative visual associations
onto some physical object you know well, such as your car or your
body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>See your car in your mind. Imagine squeezing a big apple into the
front grille. Take a carrot and stab it into the hood. On the
windshield, see grainy bread, and think to yourself, “That grainy bread
is going to damage my wipers…”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="rhyming-peg-method">Rhyming Peg Method</h3>
<p>The rhyming pegs method can be used to memorize ordered lists.
Associate the numbers one through ten with rhyming nouns – come up with
these for yourself so the association is stronger, e.g. gun or nun for
one, shoe or tattoo for two. Then “peg” an item to that numeric
association.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Item Ten (hen): Contribution:] Imagine a hen giving you presents.
She is a “contributing hen.” Ten is therefore contribution.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="spaces-in-places-method">Spaces in Places Method</h3>
<p>The spaces in places method is the mind palace technique of linking
visual associations with familiar spatial environments. This method
dates back to the turn of the first millennium and is the most famous
memorization technique. Ancient texts that discuss the method
(e.g. Rhetorica ad Herennium) recommend adding visual, auditory, and
other sensory details to strengthen the associations.</p>
<p>The core idea is that you use a room, a house, a particular drive,
some physical space that you know well and associate the items to
memorize with different objects or landmarks in this space. To recall
the items, you simply walk through the space and activate the desired
items into memory.</p>
<h3 id="linking-thought-method">Linking Thought Method</h3>
<p>The linking thoughts method is one in which you build a story out of
your associations. Items to memorize are therefore linked together
through some narrative. The example used by Horsley in the book involves
U.S. presidents – while you’re washing a tin, it grows an Adam’s apple.
A chef and her son walk by and rip it out to make some medicine to give
to Marilyn Monroe…</p>
<p>Horsley provides some tips for remember names, such as by inventing
some association with a person you already know by that name, or linking
them to a particular physical characteristic of the person. But the most
important part of this tip is simply to pay attention – actually listen
and attempt to retain the person’s name when they introduce
themselves.</p>
<h2 id="war-and-peace">War and Peace</h2>
<p>War and Peace is an 1869 novel by Leo Tolstoy. It is a 15-year saga
(1805-1820) chronicling the lives of five aristocratic families through
Napoleon’s failed invasion of the Russian Empire in 1812.</p>
<p>A lesser individual might’ve called it Soldiers and Soirees.</p>
<p>Basically, posh society watches Napoleon’s conquest with amusement
until it’s at their back door. War rages, a million people die, and
Napoleon goes home. The war leads all in both high society and war to
either die or mature.</p>
<p>It’s a historical novel with detailed musings on the inner
motivations and fears of the main characters. The novel is also
interspersed with chapters on Tolstoy’s philosophy of historiography,
which denounces the “great man theory” in favor of one in which divine
providence and the collective, compounding actions of thousands of
unremarkable individuals ultimately drive the destinies of the so-called
“great men” nominally in charge of making decisions.</p>
<p>The story features hundreds of characters but the most primary is
Pierre, who (arguably) most closely resembles Tolstoy among the entire
cast. In the story, Pierre is a moderately-willed effeminate
intellectual whose story progresses from admiring Napoleon and
revolution to despairing in love, to meaning in freemasonry, to
disillusionment in man’s constant material pursuits, to nihilism, to
desperation, to blind courage, to transcending his fear of death, to
finding meaning in the smallest of moments, and to his ultimate
fulfillment in marriage and fatherhood. Both Pierre and Tolstoy were
born in aristocracy; both tried to define themselves without it; both
were pacifists; and both found meaning in the minuscule.</p>
<p>It is an ambitious study of the mind, the human spirit, and the
material. A study of the ego, the will, and the world, at odds and in
harmony.</p>
