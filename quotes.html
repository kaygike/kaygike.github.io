    <blockquote>
    <p>A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It
    can only exist until a majority of voters discover that they can
    vote themselves largesse out of the public treasury.</p>
    <p>-- Attributed to Alexander Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee, Scottish
    jurist ca. 1800</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the
    government of himself. Can he then be trusted with the government of
    others?</p>
    <p>-- Thomas Jefferson, First Inaugural Address</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Good breeding consists in concealing how much we think of
    ourselves and how little we think of the other person.</p>
    <p>-- Samuel Clemens</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="chesterton-g.k.">Chesterton, G.K.</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p>But there are some people, nevertheless -- and I am one of them
    -- who think that the most practical and important thing about a man
    is still his view of the universe.</p>
    <p>-- G.K. Chesterton, Heresy</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>...The aim of the orator is to convince us that he is not an
    orator.</p>
    <p>-- G.K. Chesterton, Heresy</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>An enormous amount of modern ingenuity is expended on finding
    defences for the indefensible conduct of the powerful.</p>
    <p>-- G.K. Chesterton, Heresy</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="hoppe-hans-hermann">Hoppe, Hans-Hermann</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Every taxation involves the creation of two distinct and unequal
    classes: tax-payers and tax-consumers</p>
    <p>-- Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Democracy, xvii</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="joyce-james">Joyce, James</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p>-- I just wanted to say, he said. Ireland, they say, has the
    honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews. Do
    you know that? No. And do you know why?</p>
    <p>He frowned sternly on the bright air.</p>
    <p>-- Why, sir? Stephen asked, beginning to smile.</p>
    <p>-- Because she never let them in, Mr Deasy said solemnly.</p>
    <p>A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it
    a rattling chain of phlegm. He turned back quickly, coughing,
    laughing, his lifted arms waving to the air.</p>
    <p>-- She never let them in, he cried again through his laughter as
    he stamped on galtered feet over the gravel of the path. That's
    why.</p>
    <p>-- James Joyce, Ulysses, Nestor, page 36</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the
    glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all
    the queer little streets and pink and blue and yellow houses and the
    rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and
    Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I
    put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I
    wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I
    thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my
    eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my
    mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him
    down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart
    was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.</p>
    <p>-- James Joyce, Ulysses, Penelope, page 732</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="nitobé-inazo">Nitobé, Inazo</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Speech is very often with us, as the Frenchman defined it, "the
    art of concealing thought."</p>
    <p>-- Inazo Nitobé, Bushido</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>[Mencius] teaches that anger at a petty offense is unworthy a
    superior man, but indignation for a great cause is righteous
    wrath.</p>
    <p>-- Inazo Nitobé, Bushido</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="orourke-p.j.">O'Rourke, P.J.</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The government makes off with one-fourth of our goods and
    services. Then the government gives those goods and services back to
    us. (In a slightly altered form, the way a horse gives the hay we
    feed it back to us in a slightly altered form.)</p>
    <p>-- P.J. O'Rourke, Don't Vote</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>We don't vote to elect great persons to office. They're not that
    great. We vote to throw the bastards out.</p>
    <p>-- P.J. O'Rourke, Don't Vote</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>It is the duty of every politically informed and engaged person
    to do everything he or she can to prevent politics.</p>
    <p>-- P.J. O'Rourke, Don't Vote</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Republicans are the party that says government doesn't work, and
    then they get elected and prove it.</p>
    <p>-- P.J. O'Rourke, Parliament of Whores</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Whatever it is that the government does, sensible Americans would
    prefer that the government do it to somebody else. This is the idea
    behind foreign policy.</p>
    <p>-- P.J. O'Rourke, Parliament of Whores</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Theory is important, sure, but it shouldn't get between a man and
    his wallet.</p>
    <p>-- P.J. O'Rourke, Parliament of Whores</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>An important person should be treated exactly like anyone else
    holding a gun at your head.</p>
    <p>-- P.J. O'Rourke, Modern Manners</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
    <p>If you throw a drink in the face of a congressman, it will be
    regarded as a political statement, or as a moral judgment, or as an
    enviable thing others had been dying to do. But if you did not know
    he was a congressman, it will be regarded as felonious assault.</p>
    <p>-- P.J. O'Rourke, Modern Manners</p>
